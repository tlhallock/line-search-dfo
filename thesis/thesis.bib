  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a new model-based trust-region derivative-free optimization algorithm which can handle nonlinear equality constraints by applying a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) approach. The SQP methodology is one of the best known and most efficient frameworks to solve equality-constrained optimization problems in gradient-based optimization [see e.g. Lalee et al. (SIAM J Optim 8:682–706, 1998), Schittkowski (Optim Lett 5:283–296, 2011), Schittkowski and Yuan (Wiley encyclopedia of operations research and management science, Wiley, New York, 2010)]. Our derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithm constructs local polynomial interpolation-based models of the objective and constraint functions and computes steps by solving QP sub-problems inside a region using the standard trust-region methodology. As it is crucial for such model-based methods to maintain a good geometry of the set of interpolation points, our algorithm exploits a self-correcting property of the interpolation set geometry. To deal with the trust-region constraint which is intrinsic to the approach of self-correcting geometry, the method of Byrd and Omojokun is applied. Moreover, we will show how the implementation of such a method can be enhanced to outperform well-known DFO packages on smooth equality-constrained optimization problems. Numerical experiments are carried out on a set of test problems from the CUTEst library and on a simulation-based engineering design problem.},

Unlike many current methods, the proposed approach does not require feasible initial point and can handle hard constraints via a novel optimization-based constrained sampling scheme. A two-phase strategy is employed, where the first phase involves finding feasible point through minimizing a smooth constraint violation function (feasibility phase). The second phase improves the objective in the feasible region using the solution of the feasibility phase as starting point (optimization phase). The method is applied to solve 92 test problems and the performance is compared with established derivative-free solvers. The two-phase algorithm outperforms these solvers in terms of number of problems solved and number of samples used. We also apply the algorithm to solve a chemical process design problem involving highly-coupled, nonlinear algebraic and partial differential equations.},

A weaknesses we have identified with the original algorithm is the sometimes faulty behavior of the generated uncertainty function near the boundary of feasibility, which leads to more function evaluations along the boundary of feasibility than might otherwise be necessary. To address this issue, a second search function is introduced which has improved behavior near the boundary of the search domain. Additionally, the datapoints are quantized onto a Cartesian grid, which is successively refined, over the search domain. These two modifications lead to a significant reduction of datapoints accumulating on the boundary of feasibility, and faster overall convergence.},

In this paper, we use one such algorithm to optimize the beam dynamics in two cases of interest at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility. First, we minimize the emittance of a 1 nC electron bunch produced by the AWA rf photocathode gun by adjusting three parameters: rf gun phase, solenoid strength, and laser radius. The algorithm converges to a set of parameters that yield an emittance of 1.08 μm. Second, we expand the number of optimization parameters to model the complete AWA rf photoinjector (the gun and six accelerating cavities) at 40 nC. The optimization algorithm is used in a Pareto study that compares the trade-off between emittance and bunch length for the AWA 70MeV photoinjector.},

We explore problems in mixed integer/continuous domains. Six test functions are examined with 10 and 20 dimensions, with integer restrictions enforced on 0%, 50%, and 100% of the dimensions, and with noise ranging from 10% to 20% of function output.

  abstract     = {We present an improved trust region filter (TRF) method for optimization of combined glass box/black box systems. Glass box systems refer to models that are easily expressed in an algebraic modeling language, providing cheap and accurate derivative information. By contrast, black box systems may be computationally expensive and derivatives are unavailable. The TRF method, as first introduced in our previous work (Eason and Biegler, AIChE J. 2016; 62:3124–3136), is able to handle hybrid systems containing both glass and black box components, which can frequently arise in chemical engineering, for example, when a multiphase reactor model is included in a flow sheet optimization problem. We discuss several recent modifications in the algorithm such as the sampling region, which maintains the algorithm's global convergence properties without requiring the trust region to shrink to zero in the limit. To benchmark the development of this optimization method, a test set of problems is generated based on modified problems from the CUTEr and COPS sets. The modified algorithm demonstrates improved performance using the test problem set. Finally, the algorithm is implemented within the Pyomo environment and demonstrated on a rigorous process optimization case study for carbon capture. © 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 3934–3943, 2018},

The first condition requires the poisedness of the sample sets, as usual in this context, while the other one is related to the error between the model and the objective function at the sample points. Although the second condition trivially holds if the model is constructed by polynomial interpolation, since in this case the model coincides with the objective function at the sample set, we show that it also holds for models constructed by support vector regression. These two conditions imply that the error between the gradient of the trust-region model and the objective function is of the order of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\_}k{\$}{\$}$\delta$k, where {\$}{\$}{\backslash}delta {\_}k{\$}{\$}$\delta$kcontrols the diameter of the sample set.

Taking advantage of the special structure of the RBO problems, we employ a sample reweighting method to evaluate the failure probabilities, which constructs the surrogate for the reliability constraints by performing only a single full reliability evaluation in each iteration. With numerical experiments, we illustrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive against existing methods.},

Using fine-grained parallelism and asymmetric multiprocessing on multi-core CPU and modern graphics processing unit hardware simultaneously, we achieve speedups of more than tenfold over current state-of-the-art serial methods. In addition, improved mesh quality is obtained by optimizing both the surface and the interior vertex positions in a single pass, using feature preservation to maintain fidelity to the original mesh geometry. The framework is flexible in terms of the core numerical optimization method employed, and we provide performance results for both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods.},

  abstract     = {Many derivative-free methods for constrained problems are not efficient for minimizing functions on ``thin'' domains. Other algorithms, like those based on Augmented Lagrangians, deal with thin constraints using penalty-like strategies. When the constraints are computationally inexpensive but highly nonlinear, these methods spend many potentially expensive objective function evaluations motivated by the difficulties in improving feasibility. An algorithm that handles this case efficiently is proposed in this paper. The main iteration is split into two steps: restoration and minimization. In the restoration step, the aim is to decrease infeasibility without evaluating the objective function. In the minimization step, the objective function f is minimized on a relaxed feasible set. A global minimization result will be proved and computational experiments showing the advantages of this approach will be presented.},

This work explores different algorithms that exploit the structure of the quadratic models: the first one applies an l1-exact penalty function, the second uses an augmented Lagrangian and the third one combines the former two, resulting in a new algorithm. It is notable that this latter approach is uniquely suitable for quadratically constrained quadratic problems.

Firstly, the derivative-free strategy is applied to reduce the algorithm's requirement for first- or second-order derivatives information. Secondly, an interior backtracking technique ensures not only to reduce the number of iterations for solving trust-region subproblem but also the global convergence to standard stationary points. Thirdly, the local convergence rate is analyzed under some reasonable assumptions. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the new algorithm is effective.},

Given the vector of variables {\$}{\$}{\backslash}underline{\{}x\}{\_}k {\backslash}in {\backslash}mathcal{\{}R\}^n{\$}{\$}x̲k∈Rn, a new vector {\$}{\$}{\backslash}underline{\{}x\}{\_}{\{}k+1\}{\$}{\$}x̲k+1may be calculated that satisfies {\$}{\$}Q{\_}k ( {\backslash}underline{\{}x\}{\_}{\{}k+1\} ) < Q{\_}k ( {\backslash}underline{\{}x\}{\_}k ){\$}{\$}Qk(x̲k+1)<Qk(x̲k), in the hope that it provides the reduction {\$}{\$}F ( {\backslash}underline{\{}x\}{\_}{\{}k+1\} ) < F ( {\backslash}underline{\{}x\}{\_}k ){\$}{\$}F(x̲k+1)<F(x̲k).

We consider the construction of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}underline{\{}x\}{\_}{\{}k+1\}{\$}{\$}x̲k+1, using only of magnitude {\$}{\$}n^2{\$}{\$}n2operations on a typical iteration when n is large. The linear constraints are treated by active sets, which may be updated during an iteration, and which decrease the number of degrees of freedom in the variables temporarily, by restricting {\$}{\$}{\backslash}underline{\{}x\}{\$}{\$}x̲to an affine subset of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}R\}^n{\$}{\$}Rn. Conjugate gradient and Krylov subspace methods are addressed for adjusting the reduced variables, but the resultant steps are expressed in terms of the original variables. Termination conditions are given that are intended to combine suitable reductions in {\$}{\$}Q{\_}k ( {\backslash}cdot ){\$}{\$}Qk(·)with a sufficiently small number of steps. The reason for our work is that {\$}{\$}{\backslash}underline{\{}x\}{\_}{\{}k+1\}{\$}{\$}x̲k+1is required in the LINCOA software of the author, which is designed for linearly constrained optimization without derivatives when there are hundreds of variables. Our studies go beyond the final version of LINCOA, however, which employs conjugate gradients with termination at the trust region boundary. In particular, we find that, if an active set is updated at a point that is not the trust region centre, then the Krylov method may terminate too early due to a degeneracy. An extension to the conjugate gradient method for searching round the trust region boundary receives attention too, but it was also rejected from LINCOA, because of poor numerical results. The given techniques of LINCOA seem to be adequate in practice.},

  abstract     = {A surrogate-based optimization method is presented, which aims to locate the global optimum of box-constrained problems using input--output data. The method starts with a global search of the n-dimensional space, using a Smolyak (Sparse) grid which is constructed using Chebyshev extrema in the one-dimensional space. The collected samples are used to fit polynomial interpolants, which are used as surrogates towards the search for the global optimum. The proposed algorithm adaptively refines the grid by collecting new points in promising regions, and iteratively refines the search space around the incumbent sample until the search domain reaches a minimum hyper-volume and convergence has been attained. The algorithm is tested on a large set of benchmark problems with up to thirty dimensions and its performance is compared to a recent algorithm for global optimization of grey-box problems using quadratic, kriging and radial basis functions. It is shown that the proposed algorithm has a consistently reliable performance for the vast majority of test problems, and this is attributed to the use of Chebyshev-based Sparse Grids and polynomial interpolants, which have not gained significant attention in surrogate-based optimization thus far.},

  abstract     = {This paper addresses the solution of bound-constrained optimization problems using algorithms that require only the availability of objective function values but no derivative information. We refer to these algorithms as derivative-free algorithms. Fueled by a growing number of applications in science and engineering, the development of derivative-free optimization algorithms has long been studied, and it has found renewed interest in recent time. Along with many derivative-free algorithms, many software implementations have also appeared. The paper presents a review of derivative-free algorithms, followed by a systematic comparison of 22 related implementations using a test set of 502 problems. The test bed includes convex and nonconvex problems, smooth as well as nonsmooth problems. The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, TOMLAB/MULTIMIN, TOMLAB/GLCCLUSTER, MCS and TOMLAB/LGO are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, TOMLAB/OQNLP, NEWUOA, and TOMLAB/MULTIMIN show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.},

The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.}",
