We propose a model-based trust-region algorithm for constrained optimization problems 
in which derivatives and values at infeasible points of the objective and constraint functions are not available.
In each iteration, the objective function is approximated by an interpolation model, which is then minimized over a trust region.
To ensure feasibility of all sample points and iterates, we consider construct feasible buffering cones.
We present convergence analysis.
