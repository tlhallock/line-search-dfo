formatting: "Notation" is awkward
paragraphs are bold
add periods to subsections.
<date> is the last day of the semester

update all the images
the linear assumptions
make sure all the references are spelled correctly


page 93




There is a mistake the in equation 3.11, and the corresponding proof...






the algorithms look bad: they do not fit on one page
accuracy comes first, or feasibility?
		<Make sure that this is not confusing to me>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Check up on:
	the definition of p_Delta
	remove ak and bk?


find an example of partially quantifiable constraints

confirm the thesis conforms to the thesis guidelines.
update all the images.
make sure any sentence that ends in math has a period.



to understand:
	what is a critical point

to discuss:
	look at the last section
	double check the assumption that I removed


low priority:
	choose a value of t
	bilevel program for ellipsoid


high priority:
	table with longtable
	Ensure the readers are correct (double check who is on my committee).
	
	
	
	
check index numbers

convex feasible regions, it is common (crit measure)
these are equivalent if the feasible region is convex, the distinction is irrevalevent


future work
