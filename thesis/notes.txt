the algorithms look bad: they do not fit on one page
accuracy comes first, or feasibility?
		<Make sure that this is not confusing to me>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Check up on:
	the definition of p_Delta
	remove ak and bk?


find an example of partially quantifiable constraints

confirm the thesis conforms to the thesis guidelines.
update all the images.
make sure any sentence that ends in math has a period.



to understand:
	what is a critical point

to discuss:
	nowhere within the proofs do we use assumption 4.9
	is Gaussian elimination a step in LU factorization?
	concluding remarks
	not all values of $\ximin$ work
	look at the last section
	double check the assumption that I removed


lowest priority:
	add pictures to the numerical results section

low priority:
	choose a value of t
	bilevel program for ellipsoid


high priority:
	table with longtable
	Ensure the readers are correct (double check who is on my committee).
