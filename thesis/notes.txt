Ensure the readers are correct (double check who is on my committee).


make the figures section more readable
	make figures have a title and discussion
the section on the ideal solution needs math updated
the algorithms look bad: they do not fit on one page
accuracy comes first, or feasibility?
The uses of ellipsek might should be unshifted ellipse?
Check up on:
	the definition of p_Delta
	is the cauchy point sufficient for the linear case?
	remove ak and bk?


Note: I don't use assumption 4.1 until the very end



proofs with paragraphs inside...




replace:
\\begin\{lemma\}\n\\label\{
with
\\begin{lemma}\n\\label[lemma]{


clean up from the definition....



Make sure that it works with \beta = 0
which of the assumptions are redundant?
check the extra assumption...
4.5

check constants of ellipsoid proof.





definition 3.3
