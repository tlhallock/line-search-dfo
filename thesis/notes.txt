Ensure the readers are correct (double check who is on my committee).

the section on the ideal solution needs math updated
the algorithms look bad: they do not fit on one page
accuracy comes first, or feasibility?
		<Make sure that this is not confusing to me>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The uses of ellipsek might should be unshifted ellipse?
Check up on:
	the definition of p_Delta
	is the cauchy point sufficient for the linear case?
	remove ak and bk?


which of the assumptions are redundant?
check the extra assumption...
4.5

check constants of ellipsoid proof.



definition 3.3


add that it has to be only the unit ball

need a result that says we can scale the lambda poised set

apply the model improvement algorithm to the shifted and scaled sample set

what is an example
make the chi for models separate from the true projection
subscript all my \chi's


confirm the thesis conforms to the thesis guidelines.
update all the images.
