\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We propose a model-based trust-region algorithm for constrained optimization problems with linear constraints in which derivatives of the objective function are not available and the objective function values outside the feasible region are not available.
In each iteration, the objective function is approximated by an interpolation model, which is then minimized over a trust region.
To ensure feasibility of all sample points and iterates, we consider two trust region strategies in which the trust regions are contained in the feasible region.
Computational results are presented on a suite of test problems.

\section{Introduction}
Derivative-free optimization (DFO) refers to mathematical programs involving functions for which derivative information is not explicitly available.
Such problems arise, for example, when the functions are evaluated by simulations or by laboratory experiments.
Applications of DFO appear in many fields, including photo-injector optimization \cite{Neveu2017},
circuitry arrangements \cite{PLOSKAS201816}, machine learning \cite{KS2018}, volume optimization \cite{Cheng2017}, and reliability-based optimization \cite{Gao2017}.
In such applications, function evaluations are typically expensive, 
so it is sensible to invest significant computational resources to minimize the number of function evaluations required.

This work is aimed at developing algorithms to solve constrained optimization problems of the form 
\begin{align}
\begin{array}{ccl} \min_{x \in \Rn} & f(x) \\
\mbox{subject to} \quad & c_i(x) \le 0, &\quad \forall 1 \le i \le m,
\end{array}
\label{the_dfo_problem}
\end{align}
where 
% $\domain$ is a subset of $\Rn$, and
$f$ and $c_i$ for $1 \le i \le m$ are real-valued functions on $\Rn$ with at least one of these functions being a {\em black-box} function, meaning that derivatives cannot be evaluated directly.
We let the feasible set be represented as
\begin{align}
\feasible = \{x \in \Rn | c_i(x) \le 0, \; \forall 1 \le i \le m \}.
\end{align}

We are interested in developing {\em model-based}, {\em trust-region} algorithms for solving these problems.
Model-based methods work by constructing model functions to approximate the black box functions at each iteration.
The model functions are determined by fitting previously evaluated function values on a set of sample points.
In trust-region methods, the model functions are used to define a trust-region subproblem whose solution determines the next iterate.
For example, the trust-region subproblem might have the form
\begin{align*}
\begin{array}{ccl} \min_{\|s\| \le \dk}
 & \mfk \left(\xk+s\right) \\
\mbox{subject to} \quad & \mcik\left(\xk + s\right) \le 0 & \quad 1 \le i \le m, \\
& \|s\| \le \dk \\
\end{array}
\end{align*}
where $\xk$ is the current iterate, $\mfk$ is the model function approximating $f$, 
and $\mcik$ are the model functions approximating the constraint functions $c_i, \forall 1 \le i \le m$, and $\dk$ is the radius of the trust-region.
The key differences between the trust-region subproblem problem and the original are that all functions are replaced with their model functions, 
and a trust region constraint ($\|s\| \le \dk$) has been added.

%Note that we are using models of the constraint functions to approximate the feasible region during each iteration.  In particular, we define the {\em model feasible region} by
%\begin{align}
%\feasiblek = \left\{x \in \Rn \big| \mcik(x) \le 0 \quad \forall 1 \le i \le m \right\}.  \label{define_feasiblek}
%\end{align}



Conceptually, the model functions are ``trusted'' only within a distance $ \dk $ of the current iterate $\xk$; 
so the trust-region subproblem restricts the length of step $s$ to be no larger than $\dk$.
To ensure that the model functions are good approximations of the true functions over the trust region, 
the sample points are typically chosen to lie within the trust-region.

%
% {\em quantifiable} means the functions can be evaluated at any point in $\feasible$
% and that the values returned for the constraint functions provide meaningful information about how close the point is to a constraint boundary.
% This means the constraints
% For example, the authors of  apply derivative-free optimization to rapid-cycling synchrotron lattice design.
% The problem has a non-smooth objective and both linear and simulation based unrelaxable constraints.
% These constraints are unrelaxable, because simulation is not possible with overlapping synchrotron elements.
% In this case,  the constraints are called {\em unrelaxable}.
% \sbnote{Can we find an example of an unrelaxable constraint?}
We are specifically interested in applications where some of the black box functions cannot be evaluated outside the feasible region.  Constraints of this type can arise in several ways, such as when a simulation cannot be carried out on particular inputs.
For example, the authors of \cite{Padidar2021} optimize rapid-cycling synchroton lattice design,
but some overlapping synchrotron elements cannot be simulated.  Following the taxonomy in \cite{ledigabel2015taxonomy},  such constraints are called {\em unrelaxable}.    

For problems involving unrelaxable constraints,  we require all iterates and sample points to be feasible.  \replace{Notice that this feasibility requirement means that if the algorithm is stopped at any time, it will still produce a feasible output. }{}  As a first step toward developing algorithms to solve such problems,  this paper considers a simplified problem where all of the constraints are linear and unrelaxable; namely:
\begin{align}
\begin{array}{ccl} \min_{x \in \Rn} & f(x) \\
& \lca x \le \lcb, & 
\end{array}
\label{linear_dfo_problem}
\end{align}
where $\lca$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $\lcb \in \Rm$.


An important consideration in fitting the model functions is the ``geometry'' of the sample set.
This will be discussed in more detail in \cref{geometry}, but the key point is that the relative positions of the sample points within the trust region have a significant effect on the accuracy of the model functions over the trust region.
When the geometry of the sample set is poor, it is sometimes necessary to evaluate the functions at new points within the trust region to improve the geometry of the sample set.
It is well understood how to do this for unconstrained problems, but for constrained problems
our requirement that the sample points must be feasible poses some interesting challenges to maintaining good geometry.   

\sbnote{The following new paragraph discusses geometry}

In unconstrained optimization, it is typical and natural that the sample trust region be centered set at the current iterate.   Thus, much of the standard theory (see for example,   
 Chapter 3 of \cite{introduction_book}) about the geometry of the sample set assumes that the sample points are chosen within a ball centered at the current iterate.  However, for constrained problems,  this is no longer a useful assumption.   In particular, when iterates are close to the boundary of the feasible region, it is advantageous to shift the center of the sample trust region away from the current iterate.     Because of this, we rework some of the standard results so that they don't require that one of the sample points be at the center of the sample trust region.


We propose an algorithm for solving \cref{linear_dfo_problem} whose main idea is to construct a feasible ellipsoid at each iteration that lies within the intersection of the feasible region and the current trust region.   We call this ellipsoid the {\em sample trust region}.
To choose well-poised sample points for this ellipsoidal region,  we adapt a model improvement algorithm presented in \cite{introduction_book} for spherical trust regions and establish error bounds on the accuracy of the model functions over this region.    

Our convergence analysis is based on an algorithmic framework presented \cite{Conejo:2013:GCT:2620806.2621814},  which describes a class of trust-region algorithms for convex constrained minimization without derivatives.   This framework assumes that a model of the objective function can be constructed at each iteration that satisfies certain accuracy assumptions, but it does not specify how to construct such a model function.    Here, we show that the model functions constructed by our algorithm satisfy these assumptions.  Hence,  using the results from \cite{Conejo:2013:GCT:2620806.2621814}, we show that
the criticality measure for the iterates generated by our algorithm converges to zero.  As a consequence, any accumulation point of the iterates satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker first order optimality conditions.  




 \sbnote{Consider deleting the following paragraph}

We then discuss several variants to improve on the algorithm, as well as provide numerical results.
 We present several variants of how to construct the feasible ellipsoid.
 We first show how to find the maximum volume ellipsoid contained within a polytope given a fixed center.
 We then explore several strategies for shifting the center of the ellipsoid.    
 




\section{Notation}
\sbnote{Make sure we actually use all of these conventions in the paper.  That is, delete anything used in the thesis that isn't used in the linear constraint paper}
We use the following notational conventions throughout the paper.
Any variables that depend on the iteration will be super-scripted by $k$.
For example, the $k$-th iterate is given by $\xk$,
and the model of the objective function for iteration $k$ is given by $\mfk$.
Subscripts on vectors are used as an index into the vector, while vectors in a sequence of vectors use superscripts:
that is, $\xki$ is the $i$-th component of the $k$-th vector in the sequence $\{\xk\}_k$.
We use $\proj_X(x) = \argmin_{x' \in X}\left\|x' - x\right\|$ to denote the projection of $x$ onto a convex set $X$.
For any $m \in \naturals$, we define $[m] = \left\{i \in \naturals | 1 \le i \le m\right\}$.

\paragraph*{Matrices.}
Matrices are denoted with capital letters.
The $i$-th row of the matrix $A$ is denoted $A_i$.
For any index set $S \subseteq \{i \in \naturals | 1 \le i \le m\}$, the $|S| \times n$ matrix formed by only using
rows of the $m\times n$ matrix $A$ from the set $S$ is $A_S$.
Let the condition number of a matrix $Q$ be denoted $\condition(Q)$.
% , while the $i$-th column is denoted $A_{\bullet i}$.
We use $e_i$ to denote the $i$-th unit vector and $e$ to denote the vector of all ones.
$B_k\left(c; \Delta\right)$ is the ball of radius $\Delta$ in the $k$ norm, centered at point $c$.  That is,
\begin{align}
\label{define_ball}
B_k\left(c; \Delta\right) = \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | \left\|x - c\right\|_k \le \Delta \right\}.
\end{align}
Note that some of the common norms are:
\begin{align*}
\|x\|_{\infty} = \max_{1\le i\le n}|x_i|, \quad
\|x\|_{2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}, \quad \textrm{and} \quad
\|x\|_1 = \sum_{i = 1}^n |x_i|.
\end{align*}
When a norm is presented without a subscript, it is assumed to be the $2$ norm: $\|x\| = \|x\|_2$ for any $x \in \Rn$.
For matrices, we will also use the Frobenius norm $\left\|\cdot\right\|_F$ which is $\left\|A\right\|_F = \sqrt{\sum_i\sum_jA_{i, j}^2}$.
% The norm of matrices
% Also, if $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix, $\|A\|

\paragraph*{Sets.}
\sbnote{I am worried about overloading the bar notation.  We use $\bar{\Phi}$ and $\bar{Y}$ (and maybe other examples) to mean something other than the complement of $\Phi$ and $Y$.  Maybe we should use $S^c$ to denote the complement of a set $S$.}
The complement of a set $S$ is denoted as $\bar S$.
Define a point $x$ subtracted from a set $S$ as $S - x = \left\{s \in \Rn | s - x \in S\right\}$.
Set addition is $X + Y = \left\{x + y | x \in X, y \in Y\right\}$.

$\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta, $\delta_{i, j} = \begin{cases} 1 & \textrm{if} \; i = j \\ 0 & \textrm{if} \; i \ne j \end{cases}$.
We define the positive part of a real number to be
\begin{align*}
a^+ = \begin{cases} a & \textrm{if} \quad a \ge 0 \\ 0 & \textrm{otherwise} \end{cases}.\\
\end{align*}

% For any matrix $A$, we let $A^{\dagger}$ be the Moore-Penrose inverse.

%\subsection{Literature Review}

%
%Several books and survey articles  provide good introductions to the field of derivative-free optimization.
%Within \cite{introduction_book}, derivative-free methods are developed in detail.
%This is the first textbook devoted to derivative-free optimization.
%It contains an explanation of how to ensure good sample set geometry and introduces the concept of 
%poisedness for unconstrained problems, and it also covers other direct-search and line-search methods.   A review of derivative-free algorithms and software libraries can be found in \cite{miguel_review}.
%This compares several software libraries and reviews the development of derivative-free optimization since it started.
%Other recent reviews can be found in \cite{custodio_review2} and \cite{larson_menickelly_wild_2019}.
%
%Most  algorithms for derivative-free optimization fall into two main categories: direct-search methods and model-based methods.   Direct-search methods use comparatively simple strategies to explore the solution space, using only the relative ranks of function values rather than their numerical values.     Early direct search methods for unconstrained optimization include coordinate descent \cite{fermi.metropolis:numerical},  the Nelder-Mead algorithm \cite{10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308},  
%and pattern search methods \cite {hooke.jeeves:direct, kolda.lewis.ea:optimization}.   Generalizations of pattern-search methods include the GPS method \cite{torczon:convergence, Audet2002AnalysisOG} and the mesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm \cite{audet.dennis:mesh, abramson.audet:convergence}.
%
%Model-based methods guide the search using surrogate models of the black-box functions, which are constructed by fitting function values on a set of sample points.    Among the more commonly used model functions are linear and quadratic interpolation models \cite{ conn.scheinberg.ea:recent, powell:uobyqa,powell:newuoa}  and radial-basis function interpolation models \cite{oeuvray.bierlaire:boosters,wild.regis.ea:orbit,wild.shoemaker:global}.
%
%The use of model functions allows curvature information to be incorporated into the search.  As such, model-based methods tend to be more efficient than direct-search methods when the black box functions are smooth.  In contrast, direct-search methods can be better suited for handling nonsmooth or noisy functions.   They are also more straightforward to implement, and are easier to parallelize.
%
%Hybrid methods, which incorporate ideas from both direct-search and model-based methods, have also been proposed.    Some examples are described in \cite{booker.dennis.ea:rigorous}, \cite{thi.vaz.ea:optimizing}, and \cite{custodio.vicente:using}.
%
%\paragraph*{Constrained derivative-free algorithms.}
%To discuss methods for constrained derivative-free optimization,  we follow the constraint taxonomy      
%of Le~Digabel and Wild \cite{ledigabel2015taxonomy} and distinguish between whether constraints are {\em relaxable} or {\em unrelaxable}.    An unrelaxable constraint is one that {\em must} be satisfied in order to obtain meaningful information about the objective function and/or constraint functions.    Thus algorithms for unrelaxable constraints can use function evaluations only for feasible points.   We also distinguish between whether constraints are {\em algebraic} or {\em black-box}.    A constraint is algebraic if the constraint functions can be computed algebraically,  whereas a {\em black-box constraint} can only be evaluated by running simulation software.    
%
%\paragraph*{Relaxable constraints.}   The easiest class of constraints to deal with are the relaxable algebraic constraints.   In this case, ideas from classical nonlinear programming methods can easily be adapted to the derivative-free setting.  Some examples include 
% penalty methods \cite{lewis.torczon:globally, lewis.torczon:direct, bueno.friedlander.ea:inexact},   and filter methods \cite{brekelmans.driessen.ea:constrained, ferreira.karas.ea:global}.     
%Both penalty methods and filter methods allow iterates to violate constraints, requiring feasibility only in the limit.  As such, they are viable approaches only when the constraints are relaxable.    
% 
%For relaxable black-box constraints,  several methods have been proposed that allow the black-box functions to be evaluated at infeasible points.  These include penalty methods
%\cite{audet.dennis:progressive, liuzzi.lucidi:derivative-free, liuzzi.lucidi.ea:sequential,fasano.liuzzi.ea:linesearch,diniz-ehrhardt.martinez.ea:derivative-free,picheny2016bayesian}, filter methods \cite{audet.dennis:pattern, pourmohamad:combining,echebest.schuverdt.ea:inexact},  and funnel methods \cite{sampaio.toint:derivative-free,sampaio.toint:numerical}.
%
%Another approach is to construct algebraic models of the constraint functions and then require iterates to be feasible with respect to these modelled constraints.
%In \cite{glass.cooper:sequential},  linear models of nearly active constraint functions are constructed and the iterates are accepted only if they are feasible with respect to these modeled constraints.     A similar strategy is employed in the COBYLA method of Powell \cite{powell:direct}, which builds linear models of the objective and constraint functions based on a common set of sample points.    
%A variant of the MADS algorithm is proposed in \cite{burmen.olensek.ea:mesh} which uses linear regression models of the constraint functions to guide the choice of search and poll steps.   In \cite{Troltzsch2016},  the classic sequential quadratic programming algorithm is implemented for equality-based constraints.
%
%
%
%
%%Also, \cite{Gao2018} presents  an algorithm for linearly constrained derivative-free optimization that uses a backtracking technique to minimize the number of evaluations required.
%
%
%
%\paragraph*{Unrelaxable algebraic constraints.}  
%
% An algebraic constraint function can always be evaluated, so the only way it is considered unrelaxable is if a black-box function (either the objective or some other constraint function) cannot be evaluated when the constraint is violated.
%Note that it is always possible to determine whether a point satisfies an algebraic constraint prior to attempting to evaluate any black-box functions.  As such, it is relatively straightforward to modify direct-search methods to guarantee that only feasible points are considered.     
%Many direct-search methods have been proposed that take this approach
%\cite{box:new, spendley.hext.ea:sequential,may:linearly,may:solving,lewis.torczon:globally,lewis.torczon:direct,
%vandenberghen:condor, lewis.torczon:pattern2000,lucidi.sciandrone:derivative-free,chandramouli.narayanan:scaled,kolda.lewis.ea:stationarity,lucidi.sciandrone.ea:objective,

%  
%Developing model-based algorithms for unrelaxable constraints is complicated by the fact that the choice of sample points impacts the accuracy of the model functions.     Thus, when restrictions on the choice of sample points are imposed,  it can be difficult to ensure that the model functions are sufficiently accurate to guarantee convergence to a stationary point.    (see \cref{sec:polyhedral} for a more detailed explanation of this difficulty).   In the case of unrelaxable bound constraints, the restrictions on the sample points are not too difficult to mitigate.     The BOBYQA algorithm \cite{powell:BOBYQA} ensures that all points at which the objective function are evaluated satisfy the bound constraints, while still maintaining sufficient model accuracy to guarantee convergence.    In \cite{arouxet.echebest.ea:active-set},  an active set method is used when solving the bound-constrained trust-region subproblems.    In \cite{wild:derivative-free}, Wild proposed a radial basis function method for bound constraints, which enforces the bounds when selecting sample points in the model improvement algorithm and when solving the trust region subproblems.   In \cite{gratton.toint.ea:active-set}, Gratton et al. present a method which restricts the construction of the model functions to subspaces defined by nearly active bound constraints.
%
%There has also been some progress in developing model-based methods for unrelaxable linear constraints.   In  \cite{gumma.hashim.ea:derivative-free},  Gumma et al.  propose the LCOBYQA algorithm which is an extension of Powell's NEWUOA algorithm that enforces the linear constraints both when solving the trust region subproblems and when choosing sample points for constructing the model functions.    However, no convergence analysis is provided for the method.   
%
%\paragraph*{Unrelaxable black-box constraints.}   
%We now turn our attention to the hardest case--that of unrelaxable black-box constraints.   In this case,  it is not possible to guarantee that black-box function evaluations will never be attempted at infeasible points.   However, it is desireable to minimize the occurrence of such infeasible attempts.  
%
%There are several strategies for avoiding infeasible evaluations.
%The authors of \cite{Galvan2021} use a reformulation strategy by moving the constraints into the objective.
%Their work relies on a projection operator to avoid infeasible evaluations and handles non-smooth convex constraints.
%The authors of \cite{NOWPAC2014} use a path-augmentation strategy to ensure trial points are feasible.
%This is done with a local convexification of the constraints that parameterize a buffer of the constraints.
%The authors of \cite{BMNORW2020} apply DFO to optimize the Fayans energy density functional, avoiding possible infeasible evaluations by altering the objective function to include a projection onto an $L_1$ ball.
%In \cite{CONORBIT15}, the authors develop a model-based trust region algorithm that uses an envelope to avoid infeasible trial point evaluations.
%The algorithm presented within \cite{Conejo2015} is also a model-based trust region method, and it ensures each iterate is feasible, although sample points may not be.
%More recently, \cite{Brilli2021interior} uses an interior point algorithm to solve derivative-free problems with unrelaxable, black-box constraints.
%
%Of particular importance for our work is \cite{Conejo:2013:GCT:2620806.2621814}.
%This reference provides an elegant convergence proof for a class of algorithms when the constraints are convex.
%Our analysis implements abstractions made in this paper and shows the implementation satisfies their requirements.
%
%%We are not aware of any algorithms that use only feasible points to build models of the black-box constraint functions.   However,  a number of algorithms simultaneously handle unrelaxable algebraic constraints and relaxable black-box constraints.  Thus,  \cite{regis:constrained,augustin.marzouk:nowpac,augustin.marzouk:trust-region,regis.ea:conorbit}.
%
%
%
%%While care is taken to maintain the non-degeneracy of the sample points,  Powell notes that  ``Our %knowledge of the convergence properties for the algorithm is slight.''

\section{Model-Based Trust-Region Methods for DFO}

The main idea of model-based, trust-region methods is that trial points are selected at each iteration by solving a trust-region subproblem.  
Each subproblem has the form 
\[ \begin{array}{ll} \min_{s \in \Rn} & m_f^{(k)}\left(\xk + s\right) \\ 
\st & \xk+s \in \feasiblek \\
& \norm{s} \le \Delta_k
\end{array} \]
where $m_f^{(k)}$ is a model function approximating the objective $f$, $\dk$ is the trust region radius,
and $\feasiblek$ is an approximation of the feasible region.
The solution $\sk$ of the trust-region subproblem determines a {\em trial point} $\xk + \sk$.  
The objective function and constraints are then evaluated at the trial point to determine whether to accept the trial point.
If the trial point is rejected, the trust region radius is decreased and a new trial point is computed by solving a revised trust-region subproblem.     
If the trial point is accepted, then the trust region radius may be increased or decreased for the next iteration 
depending on how well the sample point improved upon the previous iterate.
This will be discussed in \cref{rhosection}.


\subsection{Assessing Model Accuracy and Trust Region Radius Management}

\label{rhosection}

% We now discuss background material for components of our algorithm.
In trust region methods, each iteration that evaluates a trial point must also test the accuracy of the model functions.
To test the accuracy, we calculate a quantity
\begin{align}
\label{define_rhok}
\rk = \frac{f(\xk) - f(\xk+\sk)}{\mfk(\xk) - \mfk(\xk+\sk)},
\end{align}
which measures the actual improvement of the trial point $\xk+\sk$ divided by the predicted improvement.  If $\rk$ is negative, the trial point is rejected and the trust region radius is decreased.   On the other hand, if the trial point is accepted, the trust region radius for the next iteration may still be decreased since 
a small value of $\rk$ implies that the model functions are not sufficiently accurate.   For larger values of $\rk$ the trial point is accepted and the trust region radius may be increased.
This strategy has been widely used within trust region frameworks such as \cite{Conn:2000:TM:357813} and within a derivative-free context \cite{introduction_book}.

To implement the above strategy,  we define parameters
% \label{define_the_gammas}
% \label{define_the_omegas}
$
0 < \gammasm < \gammabi \le 1
$
as thresholds on $\rk$ and
$
0 < \omegadec < 1 \le \omegainc
$
% $\omegadec, \omegainc$
as decrement and increment factors to determine the trust region update policy.
That is, when $\rk < \gammasm$, the trust region is decreased by a factor of $\omegadec$, and the trust region is increased by a factor of $\omegainc$
during some iterations in which $\rk > \gammabi$.


\subsection{Interpolation-Based Models}

\label{interpolation}

Model-based methods for derivative-free optimization construct models of a function $f(x)$ from a family of functions spanned by a set of $p + 1 \in \naturals$ basis functions  $\Phi = \{\phi_0, \phi_1, \ldots, \phi_p\}$. Each member of this family has the form $\mf(x) = \sum_{i=0}^p\alpha_i\phi_i(x)$ for some scalar coefficients $\alpha_i, i \in \{0, \ldots, p\}$.

We use interpolation to choose the coefficients $\alpha = [\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_p]^T$ so that $\mfk$ agrees with $f$ on a set of $p+1$ sample points $Y = \{y^{(0)}, y^{(1)}, \ldots, y^{(p)}\}$ at which the function $f$ has been evaluated.
Thus, the coefficients $\alpha$ must satisfy the \emph{interpolation condition}
\begin{align}
\label{interpolation_condition}
\mf(y^{(i)}) = \sum^p_{j=0}\alpha_j\phi_j(y^{(i)}) = f(y^{(i)}) \quad \forall \quad 0 \le i \le p.
\end{align}

% We can also write this equation in matrix form.
This equation can be written more compactly in the form
\begin{align}
\label{matrix_form}
M \alpha = \bar{f},
\end{align}
where $\bar{f} = [f(y^{(0)}), f(y^{(1)}), \ldots, f(y^{(p)})]^T$ and the Vandermonde matrix $M$ is defined by 

\begin{align}
\label{vandermonde}
M=M(\Phi,Y) :=
\begin{bmatrix}
    \phi_0(y^{(0)})      & \phi_1(y^{(0)})       & \ldots & \phi_{p}(y^{(0)})      \\
    \phi_0(y^{(1)})      & \phi_1(y^{(1)})       & \dots  & \phi_{p}(y^{(1)})      \\
                     &                   & \vdots &                    \\
    \phi_0(y^{(p)})    & \phi_1(y^{(p)})     & \ldots & \phi_{p}(y^{{(p)}})
\end{bmatrix}.
\end{align}

\sbnote{Changed notation for the Vandermonde matrix from $V$ to $M$ for consistency.   $V$ is used elsewhere to denote the volume of the ellipsoid and also in the eigendecomposition of  matrix.}
The interpolation equation \cref{matrix_form} has a unique solution if and only if $M$ is non-singular. 
In this case, we say that the sample set $Y$ is \emph{poised} for interpolation with respect to $\Phi$.   Note also that if $Y$ is poised with respect to one basis for a family of functions, then it is poised with respect to any basis for that family.     
However, even when $M$ is non-singular,  the interpolation model may be inaccurate if the Vandermonde matrix is poorly conditioned.   Informally,  we say that a sample set is {\em well-poised} if it produces accurate model functions.  The following section formalizes this idea.

\subsection{Sample Set Geometry}

\label{geometry}
The term \emph{geometry} refers to  how the distribution of points in the sample set $Y$ affects the accuracy of the model function.     In the case of polynomial model functions, a rigorous analysis of model accuracy can be performed using \emph{Lagrange polynomials}.
Let the space of polynomials on $\Rn$ with degree less than or equal to $d$ be denoted by $\polydn$ and have dimension $p+1$.
The Lagrange polynomials $\ell_0, \ell_1, \ldots, \ell_p$ for the sample set $Y$ are a basis of $\polydn$ such that
\begin{align}
\ell_i(y^{(j)}) = \delta_{i,j}  \label{interpolation_condition_lagrange}
\end{align}
where $\delta_{i,j} = \{0 \;\text{if}\; i\ne j,\; 1 \;\text{if} \; i = j \}$ is the Kronecker-delta function.
%For example, after this change of basis, note that the Vandermonde matrix becomes the identity matrix.
Thus, as shown in \cite{introduction_book},  the interpolating model function $\mf(x)$ 
satisfies
\begin{align}
\label{reg} 
\mf(x) = \sum^p_{j=0}f(y^{(i)})\ell_i(x).
\end{align}

The following definition allows us to quantify how well-poised a sample set is with respect to interpolation on a polynomial subspace.

\sbnote{Corrected the definition of $\Lambda$-poised.   We don't need a basis for the polynomial space in the definition since the Lagrange polynomials depend only on the space, not the basis.  The definition also needs to include a set $B$}

\begin{definition}\label{lambda-poised}
\replace{We say that a set $Y$ is \emph{$\Lambda$-poised} for a fixed constant $\Lambda$ with respect to a basis $\Phi$ on the set 
$B \subset\Rn$\\}{Given a fixed constant $\Lambda>0$ and a set $B \subset \Rn$, we say that a sample set $Y$ is \emph{$\Lambda$-poised} in $B$ for interpolation on $\polydn$}
if and only if the Lagrange polynomials $\ell_i$ associated with $Y$ satisfy
\begin{align}
\Lambda \ge \max_{0\le i\le p}\max_{x\in B}|\ell_i(x)|.
\end{align}
\end{definition}

To examine how $\Lambda$-poisedness relates to the accuracy of the interpolation model functions, we shall consider the Vandermonde matrix of a shifted and scaled sample set $\hat{Y} = \frac{1}{\Delta}(Y-\bar{y})$.  The analysis is similar to that presented in \cite{introduction_book}; however their analysis defines a particular  $\hat{Y}$ by choosing $\bar{y} = y^{(0)}$ and $\Delta = \max_{1 \le i \le p} \| y^{(i)}-y^{(0)}\|$.  The resulting set $\hat{Y}$  is contained in the unit ball centered at $\hat{y}^{(0)} = 0$ and has at least one point on the boundary of the ball.    This approach is sensible for unconstrained optimization, where  $y^{(0)}$ is typically chosen to be the current iterate and we are interested in constructing sample sets that are well-poised over the trust region $B_2(y^{(0)};\Delta)$.    However, for constrained optimization,  it is disadvantageous to require the current iterate to be at the center of the sample trust region or to require that there be a sample point on the boundary of the ball.   We therefore consider a more general transformation by specifying an arbitrary center $\bar{y}$ and radius $\Delta$.  

The following result from \cite[Lemmas 3.8 \& 3.9]{introduction_book} shows that the
Lagrange polynomials for a sample set are invariant under a shift or scaling of coordinates.     Hence, the poisedness constant  $\Lambda$ in \cref{lambda-poised}  is also invariant  with respect to a shift or scaling of coordinates. 

\begin{lemma}\label[Lemma]{lagrange_invariance}
Let $Y=\{y^{(0)},\ldots,y^{(p)}\}$ be a set  that is poised for interpolation on $\polydn$.  Let  $\ell_i(x)$,  $i=0,\ldots,p$, be the set of Lagrange polynomials satisfying \cref{interpolation_condition_lagrange} for the set $Y$.   Let $\Delta>0$ and $a \in \Rn$ be given and define the shifted and scaled sample set $\hat{Y}=\left\{\frac{y^{(0)}-a}{\Delta},\dots, \frac{y^{(p)}-a}{\Delta}  \right\}$.
Let $\hat{\ell}_i(x)$, $i=0,\ldots,p$ be the Lagrange polynomials satisfying \cref{interpolation_condition_lagrange} for the set $\hat{Y}$.  Then for any $x \in \Rn$, 
\[ \ell_i(x) = \hat{\ell}_i\left(\frac{x-a}{\Delta}\right),  i=0,\ldots,p.\]
\end{lemma}



 

We now state two technical lemmas that will be used in the proof of our next theorem.

\sbnote{Maybe we don't need to restate these lemmas, and can instead just reference the lemmas from the book in our proofs}.

\begin{lemma}(\cite[Lemma 3.10]{introduction_book})
\label[lemma]{lemma_3_10}
Let $\bar \Phi$ be the monomial basis \cref{define_monomial}.
There exists a number $\sigma_{\infty} > 0$ such that, for any choice of $v$ satisfying $\|v\|_{\infty} = 1$,
there exists a $y \in B_2(0; 1)$ such that $\left|v^T\bar \Phi(y)\right| \ge \sigma_{\infty}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}(\cite[Lemma 3.13]{introduction_book})
\label[Lemma]{lemma_3_13}
Let $w$ be a normalized right-singular vector of a nonsingular $n \times n$ matrix $A$ corresponding to its largest singular value.
Then, for any vector $r \in \Rn$,
\begin{align*}
\|Ar\| _2\ge |w^T r| \|A\|_2.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}







The following result, which is a straightforward generalization of  \cite[Theorem 3.14]{introduction_book},  establishes a relationship between the $\Lambda$-poisedness of $Y$ on $B_2(y^{(0)};\Delta)$) and the condition number of the Vandermonde matrix $\hat{M} = M(\bar{\Phi},\hat{Y})$, where $\bar{\Phi}$ denotes the monomial basis for $\mathcal{P}^2_n$.  Specifically,
\begin{align}
\label{define_monomial}
\bar{\Phi} = \{ \bar{\phi}_0, \ldots, \bar{\phi}_p\} =\{1, x_1, \ldots, x_n, x_1^2/2, \ldots x_n^2/2,x_1 x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}x_{n}\}.
\end{align}

%\begin{theorem}
%\label{Lambda_poised_error_bounds}
%(\cite[Theorem 3.14]{introduction_book})
%Let $\hat{M} = M(\bar{\Phi},\hat{Y})$, and $p + 1 = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.
%If $\hat{M}$ is non-singular and $\left\|\hat{M}^{-1}\right\|_2 \le \Lambda$,   
%then the set $\hat{Y}$ is $\Lambda  \sqrt{p+1}$-poised for quadratic interpolation on the unit ball $B_2(0;1)$.  
%Conversely, if the set $\hat{Y}$ is $\Lambda$-poised for quadratic interpolation on the unit ball, 
%then $\left\|\hat{M}^{-1}\right\|_2 \le \theta \Lambda \sqrt{p+1}$, where $\theta > 0$ is a 
%constant dependent on $n$ but independent of $\hat{Y}$ and $\Lambda$.
%\end{theorem}



\begin{theorem} \label{scale_the_radius}
\label{Lambda_poised_error_bounds_delta}
\sbnote{I reworked this theorem to allow for an arbitrary center, and to remove the requirement that the sample set is contained in the ball}
Let $\Delta >0$ and $\bar{y} \in \Rn$ be given and  let $Y$ be a sample set consisting of $p+1=(n+1)(n+2)/2$ points in  $\Rn$.    Define the shifted and scaled set $\hat{Y} = \frac{1}{\Delta} \left(Y-\bar{y}\right)$ and let $\hat{M}=M(\bar{\Phi},\hat{Y})$ where $\bar{\Phi}$ is the monomial basis \cref{define_monomial}.
If $\hat{M}$ is non-singular, and $\left\|{\hat{M}^{-1}}\right\|_2 \le \Lambda$, then $Y$ is $\hat{\Lambda}$-poised in $B_2(\bar{y};\Delta)$,
where $\hat{\Lambda} = \Lambda \left(p+1\right)^{-\frac 1 2}$.  Conversely,  there exists a constant $\kappa_\Lambda$ depending only on $\Lambda$ and $p$ such that if $Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised on $B_2(\bar{y};\Delta)$, then $\norm{\hat{M}^{-1}} \le \kappa_{\Lambda} \Lambda$.
\end{theorem}

%
%
%\begin{theorem}
%\label{Lambda_poised_error_bounds_delta}
%\sbnote{I tweaked the wording of this theorem}
%Given $\Delta >0$,  let $Y$ be a sample set consisting of $p+1=(n+1)(n+2)/2$ points in  $B_2(0;\Delta)$ and let $M=M(\bar{\Phi},Y)$ where $\bar{\Phi}$ is the monomial basis \cref{define_monomial}.
%If $M$ is non-singular, and $\left\|{M^{-1}}\right\|_2 \le \Lambda$, then $Y$ is $\hat{\Lambda}$-poised in $B_2(0;\Delta)$,
%where $\hat{\Lambda} = \Lambda \left(p+1\right)^{-\frac 1 2}\max\left\{1, \Delta, \frac 1 2 \Delta^2\right\}$.
%\end{theorem}



\begin{proof}(of \cref{Lambda_poised_error_bounds_delta})
Suppose that $\norm{\hat{M}^{-1}} \le \Lambda$.    
Let $x \in B_2(0;1)$ be arbitrary and let $\ell(x) = (\ell_0(x), \ldots, \ell_p(x))^T$, where $\ell_i, i=0,\ldots,p$ denote the Lagrange polynomials for $\hat{Y}$.
As shown in \cite{introduction_book}, we can write $\ell(x) = \hat{M}^{-T}\bar{\phi}(x)$, 
where $\bar{\phi}(x) = (\bar{\phi}_0(x), \ldots, \bar{\phi}_p(x))$.
Thus,
\begin{align*}
\norm{\ell(x)}_{\infty} & \le \norm{\hat{M}^{-T}}_{\infty} \norm{\bar{\phi(x)}}_{\infty} \\
& \le \left(p+1\right)^{-\frac 1 2} \norm{\hat{M}^{-1}}_2 \norm{\bar{\phi}(x)}_{\infty} \\
& \le \Lambda \left(p+1\right)^{-\frac 1 2} \max\left\{1, |x_1|, \ldots,|x_n|, \frac 1 2 x_1^2, \ldots, \frac 1 2 x_n^2, x_1x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}x_n\right\}\\
& \le \Lambda \left(p+1\right)^{-\frac 1 2}   = \hat{\Lambda}.
\end{align*}
Since $x$ was chosen arbitrarily from $B_2(0;1)$, it follows that $\hat{Y}$ is $\Lambda$-poised over $B_2(0;1)$.   Since $\Lambda$-poisedness is invariant with respect to shifting and scaling,  we conclude that $Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised over $B_2(\bar{y};\Delta)$.

Conversely, suppose $Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised over $B_2(\bar{y};\Delta)$.  Then $\hat{Y}$ is $\Lambda$-poised over $B_2(0;1)$.    Let $v$ be a right singular vector of $M^{-1}\left(\bar \Phi, Y\right)$ 
corresponding to its largest singular value and normalized so that $\left\|v\right\|_{\infty} = 1$.    By \cref{lemma_3_10},  there exists $y \in B_2\left(0; 1\right)$ such that
$\left| v^T \bar {\Phi}(y) \right| \ge {\sigma_{\infty}}$, where $\sigma_{\infty} > 0$ is the constant guaranteed by \cref{lemma_3_10}.
Then, because $\hat Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised on $B_2(0; 1)$, we have that 
\begin{align*}
\Lambda 
\ge \left\|l(y)\right\|_{\infty} 
= \left\|M\left(\bar \Phi, Y\right)^{-T} \bar \Phi(y)\right\|_{\infty}
\ge \left(p+1\right)^{-\frac1 2 }\left\|M\left(\bar \Phi, \hat Y\right)^{-T} \bar{\Phi}(y)\right\|.
\end{align*}
Applying \cref{lemma_3_13} with $A = {\bar M}\left(\bar \Phi, \hat Y\right)^{-T}$, $w = v$, and $r = \bar \Phi(y)$, we have
\begin{align*}
\Lambda 
\ge \left(p+1\right)^{-\frac1 2 }\left\|M\left(\bar \Phi, \hat Y\right)^{-T} \bar{\Phi}(y)\right\|
&\ge \left(p+1\right)^{-\frac1 2 }|v^T \bar \Phi(y)| \left\|M\left(\bar \Phi, Y\right)^{-T}\right\| \\
&\ge \left(p+1\right)^{-\frac1 2 }\sigma_{\infty} \left\|M\left(\bar \Phi, Y\right)^{-T}\right\|.
\end{align*}
The conclusion follows with $\kappa_{\Lambda} = \frac {\sqrt{p+1}}{\sigma_{\infty}}$.
\end{proof}





Having proven this relationship between the $\Lambda$-poisedness of $Y$ and the Vandermonde matrix for $\hat{Y}$,  we now establish error bounds for the model function and its derivatives based on the $\Lambda$-poisedness of $Y$.   We first state the following technical lemma from \cite{dennisschnabel1983}:
\begin{lemma}(\cite[Lemma 4.1.14]{dennisschnabel1983})
\label{4_1_14}
Let $f : \Rn \to \reals$ be Lipschitz twice continuously differentiable on an open convex set $\Omega \subset \Rn$,
with Lipschitz constant $\liphess$.
Then, for any $x + p\in \Omega$,
\begin{align*}
\left|f(x + p) - \left(f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T p + \frac 1 2 p^T \nabla^2 f(x)p\right) \right|
\le \frac {\liphess} 6 \left\|p\right\|^3.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{theorem}
\label{3_16_replacement2}
Let  $\Delta>0$  be given.  Let $Y = \left\{y^{(0)}, y^{(1)}, \ldots y^{(p)} \right\}$ be a set of $p+1=\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$ points in $B_2\left(0;\Delta\right)$.    Let  $\hat{Y}=\frac{1}{\Delta} Y$ be a scaled sample set and let $\hat{M} = M(\bar \Phi,\hat{Y})$, where $\bar \Phi$ is the monomial basis for  the quadratic polynomials.  Let $\Omega$ be an open convex set containing $B_2(0;\Delta)$.
Suppose that $f$ is Lipschitz twice continuously differentiable on $\Omega$ with Lipschitz constant $\liphess$.
Let $m: \Rn \rightarrow \real$ be a quadratic function interpolating $f$ on $Y$; that is 
\begin{align}
m\left(y^{(i)}\right) = f\left(y^{(i)}\right) \quad i=0,\ldots,p. \label{nce_interpolation_condition}
\end{align}
If $\hat{M}$ is nonsingular, then there exists a constant $\kappa$ depending only on $p$ and $\liphess$ such that the following error bounds holds for all $y \in B_2\left(0; \Delta\right)$:
\begin{align}
\left|m(y) - f(y)\right| &\le \kappa \left\|\hat M^{-1}\right\|_2 \Delta^3, \label{error_in_function}  \\
\left\|\nabla m(y) - \nabla f(y)\right\| &\le \kappa \left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|_2\Delta^2, \label{error_in_gradient} \\
\left\|\nabla^2 m(y) - \nabla^2 f(y)\right\| &\le \kappa \left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|_2\Delta. \label{error_in_hessian}
\end{align}
\end{theorem}



\begin{proof}
Let $m$ have the form $m(x) = c + g^T + \frac 1 2 x^T H x$ for some 
$c \in \reals, g \in \Rn$,  and symmetric matrix $H \in \reals^{n \times n}$. 
Define error functions $e_f$, $e_g$ and $e_h$ by
\begin{align}
e_f(x) & = m(x)-f(x) = c + g^T x + \frac 1 2 x^T H x - f(x) \label{define_e_f}, \\
e_g(x) &= \nabla m(x)-\nabla f(x) = g + H x - \nabla f(x), \nonumber \\
e_h(x) &= \nabla^2 m(x)-\nabla^2 f(x) = H -\nabla^2 f(x). \nonumber
\end{align}

Let $y \in B_2(0; \Delta)$ be arbitrary.
For each $0 \le i \le p$, we can subtract \cref{define_e_f} from \cref{nce_interpolation_condition} to find that
\begin{align}
f\left(y^{(i)}\right) - f(y) - e_f(y)
&= m\left(y^{(i)}\right) - m(y) \nonumber \\
&= g^T\left(y^{(i)}-y\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(y^{(i)}\right)^T H y^{(i)}-
\frac{1}{2} y^T H y\\
&=g^T  \left(y^{(i)} - y\right)  + \frac 1 2 \left(y^{(i)} - y\right)^T H \left(y^{(i)} - y\right) + \left(y^{(i)} - y\right)^T H y. \label{nec_eqn2}
\end{align}
% With
% \begin{align*}
% e_T(x; y) = \sum_{
% \substack{0 \le j,k,l \le n \\ j \le k \le l}}
% \frac{\partial^3}{\partial_{x_j}\partial_{x_k}\partial_{x_l}}f(y)
% \frac{(x_j - y_j)(x_k - y_k)(x_l - y_l)}{(\delta_j^k + \delta_j^l + \delta_k^l)!},
% \end{align*}
By defining
\begin{align*}
e^{(i)}_O(y) = 
f\left(y^{(i)}\right) - \left[f(y) + \nabla f(y)^T \left(y^{(i)} - y\right) + \frac 1 2 \left(y^{(i)} - y\right)^T \nabla^2 f(y) \left(y^{(i)} - y\right)\right].
\end{align*}
we can use \cref{4_1_14} with  $p = y^{(i)} - y$ to conclude that
\begin{align}
\left|e^{(i)}_O\left(y\right) \right| \le \frac 1 6 \liphess \left\|y^{(i)} - y\right\|^3 \le \frac 4 3 \liphess \Delta^3 \label{nce_bound_rhs}.
\end{align}
Furthermore, notice that
\begin{align*}
f\left(y^{(i)}\right) - f(y)
= \nabla f(y)^T \left(y^{(i)} - y\right) + \frac 1 2 \left(y^{(i)} - y\right)^T \nabla^2 f(y) \left(y^{(i)} - y\right) + e^{(i)}_O\left(y\right) \\
= \left(Hy + g - e_g(y)\right)^T  \left(y^{(i)} - y\right) + \frac 1 2 \left(y^{(i)} - y\right)^T \nabla^2 f(y) \left(y^{(i)} - y\right) + e^{(i)}_O\left(y\right).
\end{align*}
% where we know by \cite[Lemma 4.1.14]{dennisschnabel1983} that $e_O$ is a difference of two terms that
% can be bounded by can be bounded by $\frac 1 6 \liphess \left\|y^{(i)} - y\right\|^3$ and $\frac 1 6 \liphess \left\|y\right\|^3$.
% Because $\left\|y^{(i)} - y\right\| \le 2 \Delta$ and $\left\|y\right\| \le \Delta$,
% where
Subtracting this from \cref{nec_eqn2}, we find that
\begin{align*}
e^{(i)}_O\left(y\right) - e_f(y) = e_g(y)^T\left(y^{(i)} - y\right) +
\frac 1 2 \left(y^{(i)} - y\right)^T \left(H - \nabla^2 f(y)\right)\left(y^{(i)} - y\right)
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align}
e^{(i)}_O\left(y\right) &= \bigg[e_f(y) - e_g(y)^Ty + \frac 1 2 y^T \left(H - \nabla^2f(y)\right)y \bigg] \nonumber \\
&+ \bigg[e_g(y) + \left(H - \nabla^2 f(y)\right)y\bigg]^T y^{(i)} \nonumber \\
&+ \frac 1 2 \left(y^{(i)}\right)^T \left(H - \nabla^2 f(y)\right)y^{(i)}.
\label{nec_eqn1}
\end{align}
To put this equation in matrix form, we introduce some notation.
Given some $n \times n$ matrix $A$, let $\matvec : \reals^n \times \reals^n \to \reals^{\frac {n(n+1)} 2}$
vectorize the upper triangular portion of $A$:
\begin{align*}
\matvec\left(A\right) =
\left(\frac 1 2 A_{1, 1} \;,\; \frac 1 2 A_{2, 2} \;,\; \ldots \;,\; \frac 1 2 A_{n, n} \;,\; A_{1, 2} \;,\; A_{1, 3} \;,\; \ldots \;,\; A_{n-1, n} \right)^T
% \begin{pmatrix}
% \frac 1 2 A_{1, 1} \\ \frac 1 2 A_{2, 2} \\ \vdots \\ \frac 1 2 A_{n, n} \\ A_{1, 2} \\ A_{1, 3} \\ \vdots \\ A_{n-1, n}
% \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
in a similar order to that used in $\bar \Phi$ (see \cref{define_monomial}).
% \begin{pmatrix}
% e^{(0)}_O\left(\Delta^3\right) \\
% e^{(1)}_O\left(\Delta^3\right) \\
% \vdots \\
% e^{(p)}_O\left(\Delta^3\right)
% \end{pmatrix}
Then, with $e_O\left(y \right) = \left(
e^{(0)}_O\left(y\right),
e^{(1)}_O\left(y\right),
\ldots ,
e^{(p)}_O\left(y\right)
\right)^T$,
we can write \cref{nec_eqn1} in matrix form as 
\begin{align*}
M\left(\bar{\Phi}, Y\right)
\begin{pmatrix}
e_f(y) + y^Te_g(y) + y^Te_h(y) y \\
e_g(y) + e_h(y) y \\
\matvec\left(e_h(y)\right)
\end{pmatrix}
= e_O\left(y \right).
% \begin{pmatrix}
% e^{(0)}_O\left(\Delta^3\right) \\
% e^{(1)}_O\left(\Delta^3\right) \\
% \vdots \\
% e^{(p)}_O\left(\Delta^3\right)
% \end{pmatrix}
%  = O\left(\Delta^3\right)
% = \begin{pmatrix}
% e_T\left(\xi^{(0)}; y\right) \\
% e_T\left(\xi^{(1)}; y\right) \\
% \vdots \\
% e_T\left(\xi^{(p)}; y\right)
% \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
% After taking the norm, and simplifying with $\kappa_0 = \frac 4 3 \sqrt{p+1}\liphess$, we have
Thus,
\begin{align}\label{err_bnd1}
\left\|M(\bar \Phi,Y)
\begin{pmatrix}
e_f(y) + y^Te_g(y) + y^Te_h(y) y \\
e_g(y) + e_h(y) y \\ 
\matvec\left(e_h(y)\right)
\end{pmatrix}\right\|_2
&\le \left\|e_O\left(y\right)\right\|_2 \\ \nonumber
&\le \sqrt{p+1} \left\|e_O\left(y\right)\right\|_{\infty} \\ \nonumber
% \begin{pmatrix}
% e^{(0)}_O\left(\Delta^3\right) \\
% e^{(1)}_O\left(\Delta^3\right) \\
% \vdots \\
% e^{(p)}_O\left(\Delta^3\right)
% \end{pmatrix}
&\le
\frac 4 3 \sqrt{p+1} L_{\nabla^2} \Delta^3 \quad \mbox{(by \cref{nce_bound_rhs})}\\ \nonumber
&= \kappa_0 \Delta^3,
\end{align}
where $\kappa_0 = \frac 4 3 \sqrt{p+1}\liphess$.

To remove the dependence on $\Delta$ of $M(\bar \Phi,Y)$,  observe that 
\begin{align}
\hat{M}  = M\left(\bar \Phi,  \hat{Y}\right) = M\left(\bar \Phi,Y\right) \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \Delta^{-1} I_n & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \Delta^{-2} I_{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}
\end{pmatrix}. \label{nce_scale}
\end{align}
Thus, \cref{err_bnd1} can be rewritten as
\begin{align*}
\left\|\hat{M}
\begin{pmatrix}
e_f(y) + y^Te_g(y) + y^Te_H(y) y \\
\Delta\left(e_g(y) + e_H(y) y\right) \\
\Delta^2 \matvec\left(e_H(y)\right)
\end{pmatrix} \right\|_2
\le \kappa_0 \Delta^3,
\end{align*}
which implies that  
\begin{align}
\left\|e_f(y) + y^Te_g(y) + y^Te_H(y) y \right\|_2\le \kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1}\right\|_2 \Delta^3, \label{nce_first}\\
\Delta \left\|e_g(y) + e_H(y) y \right\|_2 \le \kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|_2  \Delta^3, \label{nce_second} \\
\Delta^2 \left\|\matvec\left(e_H(y)\right)\right\|_2 \le \kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|_2  \Delta^3. \label{nce_third}
\end{align}
We see that \cref{nce_third} immediately provides
\begin{align*}
\left\|e_H(y)\right\|_2 
\le \left\|e_H(y)\right\|_F 
\le \sqrt{2} \left\|\matvec\left(e_H(y)\right)\right\|_2
\le \sqrt{2}\kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|_2 \Delta
\end{align*}
where $\left\|\cdot\right\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm $\left\|A\right\|_F = \sqrt{\sum_i\sum_jA_{i, j}^2}$.
Similarily, the triangle inequality and \cref{nce_second} imply
\begin{align*}
\left\|e_g\left(y\right)\right\|_2 &\le \left\|e_g(y) + e_H(y) y \right\|_2 + \left\|e_H\left(y\right)\right\|_2\left\| y\right\|_2 \\
&\le \kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1}(\bar \Phi, Y) \right\|_2 \Delta^2
+ \left[\sqrt{2}\kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|_2 \Delta\right]
\Delta \\
&\le\left(1 + \sqrt 2\right)\kappa_0\left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|_2 \Delta^2.
\end{align*}
Finally, using \cref{nce_first}, we have
\begin{align*}
\left|e^f\left(y\right)\right| &\le \left\|e_g(y)\right\| \Delta + \left\|e_H(y)\right\|\Delta^2
+ \kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1}(\bar \Phi, Y) \right\|_2 \Delta^3 \\
& \le \left(2 +2 \sqrt 2\right)\kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|\Delta^3.
\end{align*}
Thus, the conclusion of the theorem holds with $\kappa = \frac{4}{3}(2+2\sqrt{2})\sqrt{p+1} \liphess$.

\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}  \label{error_bounds_shifted}
Let  $\Delta>0$ and $a \in \Rn$ be given.  Let $Y = \left\{y^{(0)}, y^{(1)}, \ldots y^{(p)} \right\}$ be a set of $p+1=\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$ points in $B_2\left(a;\Delta\right)$.    Let  $\hat{Y}=\frac{1}{\Delta} \left(Y-a\right)$ be a shifted and scaled sample set and let $\hat{M} = M(\bar \Phi,\hat{Y})$, where $\bar \Phi$ is the monomial basis for  the quadratic polynomials.  Let $\Omega$ be an open convex set containing $B_2(a;\Delta)$.
Suppose that $f$ is Lipschitz twice continuously differentiable on $\Omega$ with Lipschitz constant $\liphess$.
Let $m: \Rn \rightarrow \real$ be a quadratic function interpolating $f$ on $Y$.

If $\hat{M}$ is nonsingular, then there exists a constant $\kappa_0$ depending only on $p$ and $\liphess$ such that the following error bounds holds for all $y \in B_2\left(a; \Delta\right)$:
\begin{align}
\left|m(y) - f(y)\right| &\le \kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1}\right\|_2 \Delta^3,  \\
\left\|\nabla m(y) - \nabla f(y)\right\| &\le \kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|_2\Delta^2, \\
\left\|\nabla^2 m(y) - \nabla^2 f(y)\right\| &\le \kappa_0 \left\|\hat M^{-1} \right\|_2\Delta. 
\end{align}

\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Define $\bar{Y}=Y-a$ and let $\bar{\ell}_i(x), i=0,\dots,p$ be the Lagrange polynomials for the shifted set $\bar{Y}$.  By \cref{lagrange_invariance} $\ell_i(x) = \bar{\ell}_i\left(\frac{x-a}{\Delta}\right)$, $i=0,\ldots,p$.  Define $\bar{f}(x)= f(\Delta x + a)$.   Let $\bar{m}(x)$ be the quadratic polynomial interpolating $\bar{f}$ on the set $\bar{Y}$.   

Let $y \in B_2(a;\Delta)$ be arbitrary and define $\bar{y} =y-a$.  Observe that $\bar{y}  \in B_2(0;\Delta)$.    By \cref{reg},
\[ m(y)=\sum_{i=0}^p f(y^{(i)}) \ell_i(y) = \sum_{i=0}^p \bar{f}(y^{(i)}-a) \bar{\ell}_i(\bar{y})=\bar{m}(\bar{y}).\]
Note also that $\nabla m(y)=\nabla \bar{m}(\bar{y})$, $\nabla^2 m(y)=\nabla^2 \bar{m}(\bar{y})$, $\nabla f(y)=\nabla \bar{f}(\bar{y})$ and $\nabla^2 f(y)=\nabla^2 \bar{f}(\bar{y})$.  
Applying \cref{3_16_replacement2}, for all $y \in B_2(a;\Delta)$, we have
\begin{align}
|m(y)-f(y)| & = |\bar{m}(\bar{y})-\bar{f}(\bar{y})| \le \kappa_0 \left\| \hat{M}^{-1} \right\|_2 \Delta^3, \\
|\nabla m(y)-\nabla f(y)| & = |\nabla \bar{m}(\bar{y})-\nabla \bar{f}(\bar{y})| \le \kappa_0 \left\| \hat{M}^{-1} \right\|_2 \Delta^3, \\
|\nabla^2 m(y)-\nabla^2 f(y)| & = |\nabla^2 \bar{m}(\bar{y})- \nabla^2 \bar{f}(\bar{y})| \le \kappa_0 \left\| \hat{M}^{-1} \right\|_2 \Delta^3, 
\end{align}
where $\kappa$ is the constant guaranteed by \cref{3_16_replacement2}.
\end{proof}


\begin{corollary}\label[Corollary]{error_bound_lambda}
Let  $\Delta>0$ and $a \in \Rn$ be given.  Let $Y = \left\{y^{(0)}, y^{(1)}, \ldots y^{(p)} \right\}$ be a set of $p+1=\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$ points in $\Rn$.     Let $\Omega$ be an open convex set containing $B_2(a;\Delta) \cup Y$. 
Suppose that $f$ is Lipschitz twice continuously differentiable on $\Omega$ with Lipschitz constant $\liphess$.    Then there exists a constant $\kappa>0$, independent of $Y$ adn $f$ such that if $Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised  in $B_2(\left(a;\Delta\right)$ for interpolation on $\polydn$,  then the following error bounds hold for all 
$y \in B_2\left(a; \Delta\right)$,   where $m(x)$ is the quadratic function interpolating $f$ on $Y$.

\begin{align}
\left|m(y) - f(y)\right| & \le \kappa \Lambda \Delta^3,  \\
\left\|\nabla m(y) - \nabla f(y)\right\| & \le \kappa \Lambda \Delta^2,  \\
\left\|\nabla^2 m(y) - \nabla^2 f(y)\right\| & \le \kappa \Lambda \Delta. 
\end{align}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Let $\hat{Y} = \frac{1}{\Delta}(Y-a)$ and $\hat{M} = M(\bar{\Phi},\hat{Y})$.    By \cref{Lambda_poised_error_bounds_delta}, there exists a constant $\kappa_{\Lambda}$ such that 
$\norm{\hat{M}^{-1}} \le \kappa_{\Lambda} \Lambda$.  Let $\kappa_0$ be the constant guaranteed by \cref{error_bounds_shifted}.  Then by \cref{error_bounds_shifted}, the conclusion holds with $\kappa = \kappa_0 \kappa_{\Lambda}$.
\end{proof}

The following result,  
which is a special case of \cite[Corollary 4.6]{billups.larson.ea:derivative-free}.
\sbnote{Is the following Lemma true for any norm?}
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:error_bound}
  Let $f$ be twice continuously differentiable on an open convex set $\Omega$ and suppose that the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous on $\Omega$ with  constant $L$.     Let $\ell_0, \ell_1, \ldots, \ell_p$ denote the Lagrange polynomials for a poised sample set $Y=\{y^{(0)},\ldots,y^{(p)}\} \subset \Omega$.  Let $m(x)$ be the model function determined by \cref{reg}.  Then, for any $x \in \Omega$ the following error bounds hold:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $|f(x)-m(x)| \le 
      \sum_{i=0}^p  \frac{L}{2} \norm{y^{(i)}-x}^3 \left|\ell_i(x)\right| $
    \item $\norm{\nabla f(x)-\nabla m(x)} 
      \le \sum_{i=0}^p \frac{L}{2} \norm{y^{(i)}-x}^3 \norm{\nabla \ell_i(x)}$ 
    \item $\norm{\nabla^2 f(x)-\nabla^2 m(x)} 
      \le  \sum_{i=0}^p \frac{L}{2} \norm{y^{(i)}-x}^3 \norm{\nabla^2 \ell_i(x)} $.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}


\subsection{Model Improvement Algorithms}

\label{model_improvement_algorithms}
Efficient implementations of model-based methods re-use sample points from previous iterations that fall within (or at least near) the current trust region.
New points are then added to the sample set using a model improvement algorithm as described in 
\cite{introduction_book} and stated here within \cref{model_improving_algorithm}.

The model improvement algorithm starts with a set of $p+1$ sample points that have been shifted and scaled so that they lie within a ball $B_2(0;\Delta)$, with $\Delta \ge 1$.   
The algorithm then uses LU factorization with partial pivoting of the 
associated Vandermonde matrix to construct a set of pivot polynomials $\{u_0, \ldots, u_p\}$ that are closely related to the Lagrange polynomials. 


Each iteration of the algorithm identifies a point to include in the final sample set.
In particular, on the $i$th iteration, the points $y^{(0)}, \ldots, y^{(i-1)}$ have already been included.   
If a point $y^{(j)}$,  $j \ge i$ from the original set can be found such that 
$u_i(y^{(j)})$ has a sufficiently large magnitude  (i.e.,  $|u_i(y^{(j)})| \ge \xi_{\min}$),  
then that point is added to the final sample set (by swapping it with $y^{(i)}$).
However, if no such point can be found, 
it indicates that including any of the remaining points in the final sample set would result in a poorly poised set.
Therefore, the point $y^{(i)}$ is replaced by a new point that is obtained by maximizing $|u_i(x)|$ 
over the unit ball $B_2(0;1)$.
The pivot polynomials are then updated so that 
$u_j(y^{(i})) = 0$ for $j > i$.
At the successful completion of the algorithm, the final set of points $Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised over $B_2(0;\Delta)$,
where $\Lambda$ depends on $\Delta$,  $n$ and $\xi_{\min}$,  and is inversely proportional to $\xi_{\min}$
(see \cref{set_is_poised} below).
\sbnote{Discuss how to choose initial sample set.}
\paragraph*{Note.}
Typically,  we have fewer than $p+1$ previously evaluated sample points within the trust region at the beginning of each iteration.
Since the Model Improvement Algorithm requires a starting set of $p+1$ points, 
we add copies of $y^{(0)}$ to create a set with $p+1$ points.

%\sbnote{I changed the last line of Step 2 in the algorithm to include a \textbf{Stop}}


Notice that \cref{model_improving_algorithm} constructs a set of pivot polynomials $u = \left\{u_0, u_1, \ldots, u_p\right\}$,
and that $M(u, Y)$ is the upper triangular factor of the LU factorization of $M(\bar \Phi, Y)$.
The first instruction of Step 1 of \cref{model_improving_algorithm} ensures that the first point is not replaced.
The first basis polynomial is always $1$, so we can be sure that the first pivot will not need to be replaced.

Observe that \cref{model_improving_algorithm} uses a threshold parameter $\xi_{\min}$ to select the next sample point.
If $\xi_{\min}$ is too large, it is possible that there might not exist a point $x \in B_2(0;1)$ 
in the unit ball such that $\|u_i(x)\| \ge \ximin$.
In this case, the algorithm stops prematurely in Step 2 with a certification that $\xi_{\min}$ is too small.
However,  in \cref{terminates} below, we show that this cannot happen as long as $0 < \ximin \le \frac 1 4$.
To establish the result, we first need the following Lemma from \cite{introduction_book}.


%\begin{lemma}
%\label{maximum_value_for_quad}
%Let $v^T\bar \phi(x)$ be a quadratic polynomial of degree at most $d$, where $\|v\|_{\infty} = 1$
%and $\bar \phi(x)$ is the monomial bases for $\polydn$.
%Then, for any $r \ge 1$,
%\begin{align*}
%\max_{x \in B_2(0; r)} \left|v^T\bar\phi(x)\right| \ge \frac 1 4
%\end{align*}
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
% When $d = 1$,
% we have that $\bar \phi(x) = (1, x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)^T$.
% Then by letting $w = (v_2, \ldots, v_{n+1})^T$ and $\hat w = r \frac w {\|w\|}$, we see that
% \begin{align*}
% v^T\bar\phi\left(\pm w\right) = v_1 + r^2
% \end{align*}
% \end{proof}

\begin{lemma}(\cite[Lemma 6.7]{introduction_book})
\label[lemma]{book_lemma6p7}

Let $v^T \bar{\Phi}(x)$ be a quadratic polynomial, where $\norm{v}_{\infty}=1$ and $\bar{\Phi}$ is the monomial basis.
Then,
\begin{align*}
\max_{x \in B_2(0;1)} \left\|v^T \bar{\Phi}(x)\right\| \ge \frac{1}{4}.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{terminates}

For any given $\xi_{\min} \in (0,1/4]$, \cref{model_improving_algorithm}
computes a set $Y$ of $p+1$ points in the ball $B_2(0;\Delta)$ for which the pivots of the LU factorization of
$M=M(\bar{\Phi},Y)$ satisfy
\begin{align*}
\left\|u_i(y^{(i)})\right\| \ge \xi_{\min},  \quad i=0,\ldots,p.
\end{align*}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

The first pivot polynomial is $u_0(x) = 1 = (1, 0, \ldots, 0)\cdot \bar\Phi(x)$, so that $\left\|u_0\left(y^{(0)}\right)\right\| = 1 \ge \ximin$.
For $i > 1$, the $(i+1)$st pivot polynomial $u_i(x)$ can be expressed as $v^T \bar{\Phi}(x)$,
where $v = (v_0, \ldots, v_{i-1},1,0,\ldots,0)^T$.
Observe that $\norm{v}_{\infty} \ge 1$.
Let $\bar{v} = v/\norm{v}_{\infty}$.
Then by \cref{book_lemma6p7},
\[ \max_{x \in B_2(0;1)} u_i(x) = \max_{x \in B_2(0;1)} \left| v^T \bar{\phi}(x)\right| =
\norm{v}_{\infty} \max_{x \in B_2(0;1)}  \left|\bar{v}^T \bar{\phi}(x)\right| \ge \frac{1}{4} \norm{v}_{\infty} \ge \frac{1}{4}.\]

%\max_{x \in B_2(0;1)} \norm{v}_{\infty} \left|\bar{v}^T \bar{\phi}(x)\right|\max_{x \in B_2(0;1)}  \left|\bar{v}^T \bar{\phi}(x)\right|
%\ge 1/4.\]
It follows that the algorithm does not stop in Step 2 for $\ximin \le 1/4$.   Hence, at the end of the $i$-th iteration, we have that  $\left| u_i\left(y^{(i)}\right)\right| \ge \ximin$.  Moreover,  after the $i$ iteration has been completed,  $u_i$,  and $y^{(i)}$ are never altered.  Thus, the algorithm terminates with  $\left| u_i\left(y^{(i)}\right)\right| \ge \ximin$ for $i=0, \ldots, p$.

Finally,  observe that all points in the final sample set $Y$ are selected either from the original sample set, which is contained in $B_2(0;\Delta)$,  or are obtained in Step 2 from within $B_2(0;1)$.  Since $\Delta  \ge 1$, it follows that $Y \subset B_2(0;\Delta)$.

\end{proof}



\begin{theorem}
\label{set_is_poised}

Let $\Delta \ge 1$, and suppose that \cref{model_improving_algorithm} is called on a sample set 
$Y = \left\{y^{(0)}, y^{(1)}, \ldots, y^{(p)}\right\} \subset B_2(0; \Delta)$ 
resulting in a new sample set $\hat Y$,
and let $\bar{\Phi}$ be the monomial basis \cref{define_monomial}.
Then,
\begin{itemize}
\item $\left\|M(\bar \Phi, \hat Y)^{-1}\right\|_2$ as defined by \cref{vandermonde}, is bounded by a constant depending only on $p$ and $\ximin$.
\item The resulting sample set $\hat Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised over $B_2\left(0;\Delta\right)$ for quadratic interpolation,
where $\Lambda > 0$ is a constant that depends only on $\Delta$, $\xi_{\text{min}}$ and $n$ and is inversely proportional to $\xi_{\text{min}}$.
\item The initial point $y^{(0)}$ is retained in the resulting sample set: $y^{(0)} \in \hat Y$.
\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

Note that \cref{model_improving_algorithm} never swaps or replaces $y^{(0)}$.
By \cref{terminates},  $\hat Y \subset B_2(0;\Delta)$
and the pivots in the LU-factorization of $M(\bar{\phi},Y)$ are bounded below by $\ximin$; that is,
$\left|u_i\left(y^{(i)}\right)\right| \ge \ximin, \; \forall 0 \le i \le p.$
Thus, by 
\cite[Section 6.7, Exercise 3]{introduction_book}, 
 we have that 
\begin{align*}
\left\|M\left(\bar \Phi, Y\right)^{-1}\right\| \le \frac{\sqrt{p+1}\epsilon_{growth}}{\ximin}
\end{align*}
where $\epsilon_{growth}$ is a potentially large, but finite estimate of the growth factor in the LU factorizations.   By  \cref{Lambda_poised_error_bounds_delta},  using the fact that $\Delta \ge 1$, we have that $Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised in $B_2(0;\Delta)$,  where 
\[\Lambda = \left(\frac{\sqrt{p+1}\epsilon_{growth}}{\ximin}\right) \sqrt{p+1}  \frac{\Delta^2}{2} = \frac{(p+1) \epsilon_{growth}}{2\ximin}\Delta^2.\]
%
%
%
%
%Our \cref{Lambda_poised_error_bounds} is then a restatement of \cite[Theorem 3.14]{introduction_book} which 
%relates the $\Lambda$-poisedness of $Y$ to $\left\|M\left(\bar \phi, Y\right)^{-1}\right\|$ over the unit ball.
%However, \cite[Lemma 3.8]{introduction_book} and \cite[Lemma 3.9]{introduction_book} establish that $\Lambda$-poisedness is scale and translation invariant.
\end{proof}

%
%\begin{theorem}
%\label{set_is_poised}
%The sample set $Y$ obtained from \cref{model_improving_algorithm} is $\Lambda$-poised over $B_2\left(\ck, \delta\right)$ for quadratic interpolation, 
%where $\Lambda > 0$ is a constant that depends only on $\xi_{\text{min}}$ and $n$ and is inversely proportional to $\xi_{\text{min}}$.
%\end{theorem}
%
%\begin{proof}
%This result is shown through a sequence of results in \cite{introduction_book}.
%Namely,  \cite[Theorem 6.5]{introduction_book} shows the pivots in the LU-factorization are bounded below by $\ximin$:
%$
%\left|u_i\left(y^{(i)}\right)\right| \ge \ximin \; \forall 0 \le i \le p.
%$
%\cite[Section 6.7, Exercise 3]{introduction_book}
% bounds the condition number of the Vandermonde matrix in terms of these pivots:
%\begin{align*}
%\left\|M\left(\bar \phi, Y\right)^{-1}\right\| \le \frac{\sqrt{p+1}\epsilon_{growth}}{\ximin}
%\end{align*}
%where $\epsilon_{growth}$ is a large, but finite estimate of the growth factor in LU factorizations.
%Our \cref{Lambda_poised_error_bounds} is then a restatement of \cite[Theorem 3.14]{introduction_book} which 
%relates the $\Lambda$-poisedness of $Y$ to $\left\|M\left(\bar \phi, Y\right)^{-1}\right\|$ over the unit ball.
%However, \cite[Lemma 3.8]{introduction_book} and \cite[Lemma 3.9]{introduction_book} establish that $\Lambda$-poisedness is scale and translation invariant.
%\end{proof}

%Note that \cite[Theorem 6.5]{introduction_book} explicitly states an upper bound $\xi_{\textrm{alg}} > 0$ on $\ximin$, so that $\ximin \in \left(0 , \xi_{\textrm{alg}}\right)$.
%This bound depends on the choice of basis $\Phi$: $\xi_{\textrm{alg}} = 1$ for the linear case and $\xi_{\textrm{alg}} = \frac 1 4$ for the quadratic case.
%As a practical matter, these bounds are not restrictive because $\ximin$ is usually chosen small: on the order of $0.001$ for example.

%\sbnote{The following is a nice discussion!}
%
%This bound on $\ximin$ is complicated by our construction of the sample set:
%we choose points {\em near} the current iterate, although the current sample region does not necessarily include the current iterate.
%This is developed later in the thesis, and our requirements for the sample set are formalized in \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid} for the linear case and \cref{ellipsoids_notation_definitions} for the non-linear case.
%The takeaway from these requirements is that after an affine transformation to the unit ball, \cref{model_improving_algorithm} 
%will be called to construct sample points within the unit ball $B_2(0; 1)$, with an additional requirement that one of the sample points (the transformed $\xk$)
% lies within $B_2\left(0, \sqrt{2}\right)$.
%Although most practical implementations of \cref{model_improving_algorithm} choose a small $\ximin$, 
%this additional requirement further limits $\ximin$ in theory.
%This raises a question:
%for what values of $\Lambda$ (and therefore $\ximin$) can a sample set be $\Lambda$-poised if one point is chosen outside the unit ball?
%Namely, given $y^{(0)} \in B_2\left(0, \sqrt{2}\right)$:
%\begin{align*}
%\begin{array}{ccc}
%\min\limits_{\Lambda>0, y^{(i)}\in\Rn, \ell_i\in\polydn} & \Lambda & \\
%\textrm{s.t.} & |\ell_i(x)| \le \Lambda & \forall \; x \in B_2(0; 1), 0 \le i \le p \\
%& \ell_i\left(y^{(j)}\right) = \delta^i_j & \forall \; 0 \le i,j \le p \\
%& y^{(i)} \in B_2(0; 1) & \forall \; 1 \le i \le p.
%\end{array}
%\end{align*}
%We have not encountered an issue choosing $\ximin$ too large,
%but we are interested in bounding this program's solution.
%

\subsection{Criticality Measure}

\label{criticality_measure_section}
\label{criticallity_measure_section}

\sbnote{Simplify this section, since we are dealing only with linear constraints.}

A key component of any optimization algorithm is the {\em criticality measure}, which is used to define stopping criteria for the algorithm.
The criticality measure $\chi(x^{(k)})$ at an iterate $x^{(k)}$ is a nonnegative quantity that is zero if and only if $x^{(k)}$ satisfies necessary optimality conditions.
For unconstrained problems,  a typical choice of criticality measure for classical (gradient-based) algorithms is given by $\chi(x) = \norm{\nabla f(x)}$
since the first order optimality condition is $\nabla f(x)=0$.
The algorithm then terminates when $\chi(x) < \tolcrit$, where $\tolcrit >0$ is a stopping tolerance.

For derivative-free optimization,  $\nabla f(x)$ is not available,  so the true criticality measure is replaced by the model criticality measure
$\chik(x) = \norm{\nabla \mfk\left(x\right)}.$
Note however that $\chik$ is only an accurate approximation of $\chi(x)$ if the gradient of the model function $\nabla \mfk(x)$ is a close approximation to $\nabla f(x)$.
For this reason, derivative-free algorithms require not only that $\chik(x)$ is small, but also that the model functions are accurate.
To accomplish this, we require poised sample sets as discussed in \cref{geometry} with the trust-region radius converging to zero.
Once the criticality measure has reached a small enough threshold $\tolcrit > 0$ and the trust region is small enough ($\dk < \tau_{\Delta}$),
we can terminate the algorithm.



%In the presence of convex constraints,
If the feasible region $\feasible$ is convex, a classic criticality measure (see, for example \cite{Conejo:2013:GCT:2620806.2621814} \cite{Conn:2000:TM:357813}) is given by
\begin{align*}
\chi(x) = \left\|x - \proj_{\feasible}\left(x- \nabla f\left(x\right)\right)\right\|.
\end{align*}
If the feasible region is not convex, the projection operation is not well-defined, so this criticality measure is not helpful.
Moreover,  even with a convex feasible region, we need a way to determine the projection, so we prefer a criticality measure based on the  functions defining the constraints.   In particular, for
a first order criticality measure at $\xk$, we define
\begin{align}
\truefeasiblek &= \left\{ x \in \Rn \bigg| c_i\left(\xk\right) + \nabla c_i\left(\xk\right)^T \left(x - \xk\right) \le 0 \; \forall i \in [m] \right\} \label{define_truefeasiblek}
\end{align}
and use
\begin{align}
\chi_c^{(k)}(x) = \left\|x - \proj_{\truefeasiblek}\left(x- \nabla f\left(x\right)\right)\right\|. \label{define_true_criticality}
\end{align}

Note that $\chi_c^{(k)}(\xk) = 0$ if and only if $\xk$ satisfies the first order Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.
% This condition is necessary under regularity assumptions and with convex
% For a convex problem convex constraints with a convex objective, this condition would be necessary and sufficient for local optimality under regularity assumptions.
Unfortunately,  without derivative information, we cannot calculate $\chi_c^{(k)}$ directly, so in our algorithms we approximate it with
\begin{align}
\label{define_criticality_measure}
\chik = \left\|\xk - \proj_{\feasiblek}\left(\xk- \nabla \mfk\left(\xk\right)\right)\right\|,
\end{align}
where $\feasiblek$ is the model feasible region defined by
\begin{align}
\feasiblek = \left\{x \in \Rn \big| \mcik(x) \le 0 \quad \forall 1 \le i \le m \right\}.  \label{define_feasiblek}
\end{align}

This quantity measures how far the current iterate $\xk$ is from satisfying the first order optimality conditions for the model function $\mfk$.
In turn, as $\dk \to 0$, the model $\mfk$ better approximates $f$, $\feasiblek$ better approximates $\feasible$ and $\xk$ approaches a critical point for $f$.

%With general constraints, we cannot use $\proj_{\feasible}$ because the projection is not well defined.
%However, the linearization \cref{define_truefeasiblek} is still well defined.
%Thus, it is possible to use \cref{define_criticality_measure} with general constraints to satisfy the first order necessary conditions.
% However, unlike for convex constraints, points with a linearized criticality measure of $0$ are not necessarily local extremum.



% For now, our algorithm is designed to work with convex constraints, so we employ a classic criticality measure discussed in  of
% The first order optimality conditions for $x^{\star} \in \Rn$ to by a local optimum of $f$ is that $x^{\star}$ satisfies
% \begin{align*}
% x^{\star} = \proj_{\feasiblek}\left(x^{\star} - \gradf(x^{\star})\right).
% \end{align*}
% % that we use as thresholds to determine when the criticallity measure and trust region radius are sufficiently small.

%
% We still employ thresholds
% \begin{align}
%
% \end{align}
% for stopping conditions.

%%A set of poised points are chosen for some radius $\Delta_k>0$ about the current iterate.
%The objective value and derivatives are approximated in a trust region around the current iterate to construct their model functions.
%Next, this model function is minimized over the trust region and the minimum argument becomes the trial point.
%The objective is evaluated at the trial point and a measure of reduction $\rho$ is computed.
%If $\rho$ implies that sufficient reduction has been made and that the model approximates the function well, the trial point is accepted as the new iterate.
%Otherwise, the trust region is reduced to increase model accuracy.
%The algorithm terminates when both a criticality measure $\chik$ and the trust region radius $\Delta_k$ reach sufficiently small thresholds of $\tau_{\chi}$ and $\tau_{\Delta}$.

%This derivative-free optimization algorithm differs from the classical trust region algorithm in two important respects:
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Models are constructed without derivative information.
%    \item The trust region radius $\Delta_k$ must go to zero as $k\to\infty$.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%This is required to ensure that the gradient of the model function closely approximates the gradient of $f$.
%Our goal is to generalize this framework to handle constraints,
%where we must ensure no constraint violation occurs
%while also ensuring the accuracy of the models of the constraints.







\section{Algorithm Description}
\label{sec:linear}
We now describe our algorithm for solving the linearly constrained problem
\begin{align}
\label{eq:DFO-linear}
\begin{array}{ccl} \min_{x \in \Rn} & f(x) \\
\textrm{s.t.} & \lca x \le \lcb & 
\end{array}
\end{align}
where $f:\Rn\rightarrow\reals$ is a black-box function, 
$\lca$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $\lcb \in \Rm$.
For convenience, we assume that each row of the constraint matrix has been normalized so that $\left\|\lca_i\right\| = 1$ for each $i \in [m]$.  

\sbnote{It would sure be nice to get rid of $\frac{1}{2} \delta_k^2$ in the definition of $\sampletrk$).}

A key idea of our method is to define an ellipsoidal sample trust region $\sampletrk$ at each iteration from which new sample points will be chosen.   The sample trust region has the form
\begin{equation}
\label{define_the_sample_region}
\sampletrk = \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | \left(x - \ck\right)^T \qk \left(x - \ck\right) \le \frac 1 2 \sdk^2 \right\},
\end{equation}
where we choose the symmetric positive definite matrix $\qk$, vector $\ck \in \Rn$, and constant $\sdk > 0$ so that
the sample region lies within the intersection of the feasible region and an outer trust region defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{define_outer_trust_region}
\outertrk = B_{\infty}\left(\xk;\dk\right),
\end{equation}
where $x^{(k)}$ is the current iterate and $\Delta_k$ is the current trust region radius.
After  $\sampletrk$ is constructed,  sample points are selected by applying the model improvement algorithm  (\cref{model_improving_algorithm}) 
to a transformed problem in which the ellipsoid $\sampletrk$ is mapped onto the unit ball. 

To make this concrete, let $\qk = V D^2 V^T$ be the eigendecomposition  of $\qk$, 
where $V^TV = I$ and $D$ is a diagonal matrix with positive entries.  Define
$T:\Rn \times \Rn_+ \rightarrow \Rn$ by $T(x; \delta) = \frac{\delta}{\sdk} DL^T\left(x - \ck\right)$.
Note that  $T(\cdot,\sqrt{2})$ is invertible and maps $\sampletrk$ onto the unit ball
$B_2(0;1)$:  \sbnote{maybe we can delete the following}
\begin{align*}
\delta^2 \ge \|T\left(x; \sqrt{2}\delta\right)\|^2 = \left\|\frac {\sqrt{2}\delta} {\sdk} DV^T(x - \ck)\right \|^2
= \frac {2\delta^2} {\sdk^2} \left(x - \ck\right)^TQ\left(x - \ck\right) \\
\Longleftrightarrow \left(x - \ck\right)^TQ\left(x - \ck\right) \le \frac 1 2 \sdk^2.
\end{align*}

To apply \cref{model_improving_algorithm}, we calculate a transformed sample set $\hat{Y}$ by computing $T(y^{(i)};\sqrt{2})$ for each $y^{(i)} \in Y$, where $Y$ is a starting set of $p+1$ previously evaluated sample points.    

\sbnote{We need to specify somewhere how we choose $Y$ for each iteration.    For example, we might say the following: 
We construct $Y$ by choosing at most $p$ sample points from the previous iteration that lie within $\sampletrk$ and then add enough copies of the current iterate $x^{(k)}$ to create a set with $p+1$ points.  }

The complete process is formalized in \cref{model_construction_algorithm}.

%Likewise, with $\scaledellipsek$ defined in \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}, we have that
%$T\left(\scaledellipsek; \delta\right) = B_2(0; \delta)$.

\section{Convergence Analysis}
\label{linear_convergence_discussion} 

For our convergence analysis, we make the following assumptions about the problem.
Let $\domain$ be an open convex set containing $\feasible$.   

\begin{assumption}
\label{for_fully_quadratic}
\label{lipschitz_hessian}
The function $f$ is twice continuously differentiable with Lipschitz continuous Hessian in $\domain$.   That is, there exists constant $\liphess > 0$ such that 
\begin{align}
\left\|\nabla^2 f(x) - \nabla^2 f(y)\right\| \le \liphess \left\|x - y\right\| \quad \forall x, y \in \domain.
\end{align}
\end{assumption}

% \begin{boxedcomment}
% Do we need $f$ to be bounded above (since my models are interpolating $f$)?
% \end{boxedcomment}



\begin{assumption}
\label{lower_bound}
The function $f$ is bounded below over $\domain$.
That is,
\begin{align}
f(x) \ge \fmin \quad \forall x \in \domain.
\end{align}
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption}
\label{interior_point}
There exists a point $\bar x$ within the interior of the feasible region.
Namely, using $\lca$ and $\lcb$ from \cref{eq:DFO-linear}:
\begin{align}
\lca \bar x < \lcb.
\end{align}
\end{assumption}


\begin{assumption}
\label{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f} \sbnote{I changed $\beta-1$ to $\beta$ in this assumption and in H3 from conejo et al.  for simplicity}.
The Hessians of $f$ are uniformly bounded at each iterate. That is, there exists a constant $\beta \ge 0$ such that
\begin{align*}
\left\|\nabla^2 f\left(\xk\right)\right\| \le \beta \quad \forall k \in \naturals.
\end{align*}
\end{assumption}

In addition to the above assumptions about the problem, we also require that the sequence of sample trust regions $\{\sampletrk\}$ are \emph{suitable} as defined in \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid} below.   
  Later, in \cref{the_safe_ellipsoid}, we describe one method for constructing such a sequence.

To simplify notation, define $\lctra = \begin{pmatrix} \lca \\ I \\ -I \end{pmatrix}$ and 
$\lctrb = \begin{pmatrix} \lcb \\ \xki+\dk \\ -\xki+\dk \end{pmatrix}$.
We then define
\begin{align}
\polyk = \feasible \cap \outertrk =  \{x \in \Rn | \; \lca x \le \lcb, \|x - \xk\|_{\infty} \le \dk \} \label{polyhedron_k}  \\
= \{x \in \Rn | \lctra x \le \lctrb \}. \nonumber
\end{align}
Note that we will still have $\|\lctra_i\| = 1$ for each $i \in [m]$.

\begin{definition}
\label[definition]{define_suitable_ellipsoid}
Let $\left\{\qk\right\}$ be a sequence of positive definite symmetric matrices,
$\left\{\ck\right\} \subset \Rn$ be a sequence of points, and $\left\{\sdk\right\}$ be a sequence of positive scalars.
For each $k \in \naturals$, define the ellipsoids
\begin{align*}
\ellipsek &= \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg| \left(x - \ck\right)^T\qk\left(x - \ck\right) \le \frac 1 2 \sdk^2 \right\}, \textrm{and} \\
\scaledellipsek &= \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | \left(x - \ck\right)^T\qk\left(x - \ck\right) \le  \sdk^2 \right\}.
\end{align*}
The sequence $\left\{\ellipsek\right\}$ is said to be \emph{suitable} if all of the following are satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $\ellipsek \subseteq \polyk$, where $\polyk$ is defined by \cref{polyhedron_k},
\item[2.] $\xk \in \scaledellipsek$,
\item[3.] The condition number $\condition \left(\qk\right)$ is bounded independently of $k$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


We begin our analysis by examining how the shapes of the ellipsoidal sample trust regions $\sampletrk$ affect the accuracy of the interpolating model functions.    Recall that the standard model improvement algorithm (\cref{model_improvement} produces a well-poised sample set over a ball $B_2(0;\Delta)$ resulting in accurate model functions.     The following Lemma shows that applying that algorithm to the transformed sample set, as done in \cref{model_construction_algorithm},  also produces accurate model functions for the ellipsoidal sample trust regions $\sampletrk$,  provided that we have a uniform bound on the condition numbers of the matrices $\qk$ in \cref{define_the_sample_region}.  

\sbnote{I think $\kappa$ is too overloaded.  Perhaps we should use a different symbol for the condition number?}
\begin{lemma}

\label[lemma]{shifted_ellipsoid}
Let $\sdk>0$, $\ck \in \Rn$ and a symmetric matrix $\qk \succ 0$ be given.
Let the eigen decomposition of $\qk$ be $\qk = VD^2V^T$, $V^TV = I$, where $D$ is diagonal with positive entries.
Let $\scaledellipsek$ be defined by
\begin{align*}
\scaledellipsek = \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | \left(x - \ck\right)^T \qk\left(x - \ck\right) \le \sdk^2 \right\}
% \subseteq B_{\infty}\left(\xk, \dk\right).
\end{align*}

For $\delta > 0$, define the transformation $T(x; \delta) = \frac{\delta}{\sdk} D V^T\left(x - \ck\right)$,
and let $\delta_r = \max_{x \in \scaledellipsek}\|x - \ck\|$.
Let $\hat m_f(u)$ be a model of the shifted objective $\hat f(u) = f(T^{-1}(u; \delta_r))$ such that,
for constants $\kappa_{ef}, \kappa_{eg}, \kappa_{eh} > 0$, the following error bounds hold for all $u \in B_2(0;\delta_r)$:

\begin{align}
|\hat m_f(u) - \hat f(u)| \le \kappa_{ef} \delta_r^3, \label{shifted_ellipsoid_bounds}\\
\|\nabla \hat m_f(u) - \nabla \hat f(u)\| \le \kappa_{eg}\delta_r^2, \label{shifted_ellipsoid_bounds2} \\
\|\nabla^2 \hat m_f(u) - \nabla^2 \hat f(u)\| \le \kappa_{eh}\delta_r.  \label{shifted_ellipsoid_bounds3}
\end{align}

Then, with
\begin{align*}
\kappa_{ef}' = \kappa_{ef}, \\
\kappa_{eg}' = \kappa_{eg}\sqrt{\kappa(\qk)}, \\
\kappa_{eh}' = \kappa_{eh}\condition(\qk),
\end{align*}
the model function $m_f(x) = \hat m_f(T(x; \delta_r))$ satisfies the following error bounds for all
$x \in  \scaledellipsek$:
\begin{align}
| m(x) - f(x)| \le \kappa_{ef}'\delta_r^3, \label{transformed_error_bounds} \\
\|\nabla  m(x) - \nabla  f(x)\| \le \kappa_{eg}'\delta_r^2, \label{transformed_error_bounds2} \\
\|\nabla^2 m(x) - \nabla^2 f(x)\| \le \kappa_{eh}'\delta_r \label{transformed_error_bounds3}.
\end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}


Noting that $D_{i, i} > 0$, observe that
\begin{align*}
\delta_r^2 = \frac {\sdk^2} {\lambda_{\text{min}}\left(\qk\right)} = \frac {\sdk^2} {\min_{i \in [n]} D^2_{i, i}},
\end{align*}
so $\min_{i} D_{i, i} = \frac{\sdk^2}{\delta_r^2}$.

Thus,
\begin{align*}
\condition\left(\qk\right) 
= \kappa\left(D^2\right) 
= \frac{\max_{i}D_{i,i}^2}{\min_{i}D_{i,i}^2} 
= \frac{\delta_r^2}{\sdk^2} \max_{i}D_{i,i}^2 = \frac{\delta_r^2}{\sdk^2}\|D\|^2 \\
\Longrightarrow \frac{\delta_r} {\sdk} \|D\| = \sqrt{\condition\left(\qk\right)}.
\end{align*}
%  \le \frac{\kappa_{\lambda}}{\delta}.
Let $x \in \ellipsek$ be arbitrary and let $u = T(x) \in B_2(0;\delta_r)$.
Then
\begin{align*}
 | m_f(x) - f(x)| = |\hat m(u) - \hat f(u)| \le \kappa_{ef}'\delta_r^3.
\end{align*}
Similarly, for the gradient we find:
\begin{align*}
\| \nabla m_f(x) - \nabla f(x)\| &= \left\|\frac{\delta_r} {\sdk}DL^T\left(\nabla\hat m_f(u) - \nabla \hat f(u)\right)\right\| \\
& \le \frac{\delta_r} {\sdk} \|DL^T\|\|\nabla \hat m_f(u) - \nabla \hat f(u)\| \\
& \le \sqrt{\condition(\qk)}\kappa_{eg} \delta_r^2 = \kappa_{eg}' \delta_r^2.
\end{align*}
Finally,  for the Hessian, we have
\begin{align*}
\| \nabla^2 m_f(x) - \nabla^2 f(x)\| & = \left\|\frac{\delta_r^2} {\sdk^2}DL^T\left(\nabla\hat m_f(u) - \nabla \hat f(u)\right)LD^T\right\| \\
& \le \frac{\delta_r^2} {\sdk^2} \|D\|^2\|\nabla \hat m_f(u) - \nabla \hat f(u)\| \\
& \le \condition(\qk)\kappa_{eh} \delta_r = \kappa_{eh}' \delta_r.
\end{align*}

\end{proof}

The remainder of our analysis closely follows that of \cite{Conejo:2013:GCT:2620806.2621814},
which presents a class of trust region algorithms for derivative-free optimization with convex constraints.
In fact, if the tolerances $\tau_{\chi}$ and $\tau_{\Delta}$ are set to zero,  
then \cref{linearly_constrained_dfo_simple} is a particular implementation of the algorithm studied within this reference.
The only modification is in the trust region subproblem, in which we allow for more trial points with an $L_{\infty}$ ball instead of an $L_2$ ball.
We have also included a modification that $\dk \le \dmax$; however, this does not alter any of the convergence results.  In fact, the authors allow $\omegainc = 1$, so that the trust region radius can never be increased.
It is therefore sufficient to show that the model functions generated by our method satisfy the hypotheses required for their analysis.

The analysis in \cite{Conejo:2013:GCT:2620806.2621814}  assumes that the model of the objective is quadratic and satisfies an efficiency condition.
Namely, there exists a constant $\kappa_f$ such that for all $k \in \naturals$,  \sbnote{yet another $\kappa$!   Make sure there is no conflict regarding the use of $\kappa_f$ (versus, say $\kappa_{ef}$.}
\begin{align}
\label{efficiency}
\mfk\left(\xk\right) - \mfk\left(\xk + \sk\right) \ge \kappa_f \chik \min\left\{ \frac{\chik}{1+\left\|\nabla^2 \mfk(\xk)\right\|}, \dk, 1 \right\},
\end{align}
where $\chik$ is defined by \cref{define_criticality_measure}.
The Generalized Cauchy Point is shown to satisfy \cref{efficiency} within \cite{Conn:2000:TM:357813}.
This is a reasonable choice for $\sk$, but the exact solution as chosen within \cref{linearly_constrained_dfo_simple} 
necessarily also satisfies \cref{efficiency} as it can only improve upon the Generalized Cauchy Point.
Also, note that although \cite{Conejo:2013:GCT:2620806.2621814} presents a criticality measure based on the true projection onto the constraints,
for linear constraints, this precisely coincides with the models used in \cref{define_criticality_measure}.

The authors of \cite{Conejo:2013:GCT:2620806.2621814} also make four explicit assumptions, which are satisfied by our algorithm under our assumptions.     
Their first assumption $H_1$ requires the function $f$ to be differentiable and its gradient $\nabla f$ to be Lipschitz continuous with constant $L > 0$ in $\domain$.  This is satisfied by our 
\cref{lipschitz_hessian} which is a strictly stronger assumption.
Their second assumption $H_2$ is equivalent to our \cref{lower_bound}.    Their third assumption $H_3$ is that
the Hessians of the model functions $\mfk$ are uniformly bounded.    In particular they assume that there exists a constant $\beta_2 \ge 0$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_mf}
 \left\|\nabla^2 \mfk(x^{(k)})\right\| \le \beta_2 \quad \forall k \ge 0.
 \end{equation}
Our  \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f}
 is similar, except that it imposes a bound on the Hessian of the objective function $f$.    We show in \cref{replacing_h3} below that under this assumption,  the model functions $\mfk$ constructed by our algorithm will satisfy \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_mf}.

The final assumption, $H_4$,  from \cite{Conejo:2013:GCT:2620806.2621814} is an accuracy condition.  Namely, it assumes that there exists a constant $\delta_g > 0$ such that for all $k \in \naturals$, 
\begin{equation}\label{accuracy}
\left\| \nabla \mfk(x^{(k)}) - \nabla f(x^{(k)} \right\| \le \delta_g \Delta_k.
\end{equation}

In \cref{linear_accuracy_is_satisfied} we show that this accuracy condition is satisfied.


\sbnote{The following theorem only states a small portion of what you actually prove.  I would like to reword as in the the revised theorem below. }
\begin{theorem}
\label{linear_accuracy_is_satisfied}

Suppose that \cref{lipschitz_hessian}, \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f}, and \cref{interior_point} hold.
Suppose further that for each iterate $k$, the ellipsoids $\ellipsek$ and $\scaledellipsek$ provided by the \emph{ConstructTrustRegion} subroutine 
are suitable according to \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid},
and the sample set is constructed by calling \cref{model_construction_algorithm}.


Then, $m_f\left(\xk\right) = f\left(\xk\right)$, and
the accuracy condition \cref{accuracy} is satisfied for each iterate $k$.
Namely, there exists $\kappa_{g} > 0$ such that 
\begin{align*}
\left\|\nabla m_f\left(\xk\right) - \nabla f\left(\xk\right)\right\| \le \kappa_g \dk \quad \forall k \in \naturals.
\end{align*}
\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}
\label{linear_accuracy_is_satisfied}

Suppose that \cref{lipschitz_hessian}, \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f}, and \cref{interior_point} hold.  
Suppose further that 
 \replace{for each iterate $k$, the ellipsoids $\ellipsek$ and $\scaledellipsek$ provided by the \emph{ConstructTrustRegion} subroutine}{the sample trust region ellipsoids $E^{(k)}=\sampletrk, k=0,\ldots$,}  
are suitable according to \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}, and let $\scaledellipsek$ be defined as in \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}.    For each iterate $k$, let $\mfk(x)$ be constructed by \cref{model_construction_algorithm}.    
Then,  there exist constants $\kappa_{ef}, \kappa_{eg}, \kappa_{eh}$, independent of $k$,  such that for all $x \in \scaledellipsek$ the following error bounds hold:
 \begin{align*}
|\mfk(x) - f(x)| \le \kappa_{ef} \delta_r^3, \\
\|\nabla \mfk(x) - \nabla  f(x)\| \le \kappa_{eg}\delta_r^2,  \\
\|\nabla^2 \mfk(x) - \nabla^2  f(x)\| \le \kappa_{eh}\delta_r. 
\end{align*}


\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
\
By the definition of suitability, we have that $\ellipsek \subset \polyk$ and $\xk \in \scaledellipsek$ and that there is a bound $\kappa_{max}$ such that $\kappa(Q^{(k)})\le \kappa_{max}$ for all $k$.
As in \cref{shifted_ellipsoid},  give $Q^{(k)} = LD^2L^T$ its eigen-decomposition.
Define the transformation $T(x; \delta) = \frac{\delta}{\sdk^2} D L^T\left(x - \ck\right)$.
Notice that 
the transformation $T\left(x; \sqrt{2}\right)$ maps $\sampletrk = \ellipsek$ to the unit ball.
After using \cref{model_improving_algorithm} to choose sample points, we know by \cref{set_is_poised}
that there is a bound $\Lambda>0$ with $\left\| M\left(\bar \Phi, \hat Y\right)^{-1}\right\| \le \Lambda$ depending only on $p$ and $\ximin$.
Next,  consider the shifted sample set $\bar Y = \sqrt{2}\frac{\delta_r}{\delta_2} \hat Y$, where $\delta_r = \max_{x \in \scaledellipsek}\|x - \ck\|$.
By \cref{3_16_replacement2},  there are fixed constants $\kappa_f, \kappa_g, \kappa_h > 0$ such that
\begin{align*}
\left| \hat {f}\left(u\right) - \hat{m}_f\left(u\right) \right|\le \kappa_f\Lambda \delta_r^3, \\
\left\|\nabla \hat {f}\left(u\right) - \nabla \hat{m}_f\left(u\right) \right\|\le \kappa_g\Lambda \delta_r^2, \\
\left\|\nabla^2 \hat {f}\left(u\right) - \nabla^2 \hat{m}_f\left(u\right) \right\|\le \kappa_h\Lambda \delta_r.
\end{align*}
for all $u \in B_2\left(0, \delta_r\right)$.
This means that the shifted functions
$\hat {m}_f^{(k)}(u) = \mfk(T^{-1}(u); \delta)$ and
$\hat f (u) = f(T^{-1}(u; \delta))$
as described in \cref{shifted_ellipsoid},
satisfy \cref{shifted_ellipsoid_bounds}---\cref{shifted_ellipsoid_bounds3},
and therefore \cref{transformed_error_bounds}---\cref{transformed_error_bounds3}.


Because $\condition \left(\qk\right)$ is bounded by some $\epsilon_{\alpha} > 0$ independently of $k$,
and defining $\kappa'_{g} =  \kappa_g\sqrt{\epsilon_{\alpha}}\Lambda\dmax$, we see that
we can use  \cref{shifted_ellipsoid} to conclude that for all $x_0 \in \scaledellipsek$:
\begin{align*}
\left\|\nabla f\left(x_0 \right) - \nabla m_f\left(x_0\right)\right\| \le 
\kappa_g  \Lambda\dk^2 \sqrt{\condition \left(\frac 2 {\delta_k} Q^{(k)}\right)}
=  \kappa_g \sqrt{\epsilon_{\alpha}}\Lambda\dmax\dk 
= \kappa'_g\dk.
\end{align*}
In particular, $\xk \in \scaledellipsek$.
\end{proof}

%With this modest assumption, we can make the assumptions more straightforward by replacing \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_mf} with \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f}:

%\subsection{Bounded Hessians}
%\label{simpler_h3}
%
%First, we show that \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f} can be used instead of \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_mf}.

\sbnote{The following lemma assumes that all of the sample sets are $\Lambda$-poised.   So you need to prove that this is the case (based on suitability)}
\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{replacing_h3}

Suppose that \cref{lipschitz_hessian} and \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f} hold.
Let $\mfk$ be a quadratic model interpolating $f$ on a $\Lambda$-poised sample set
$Y$ over $B_{2}\left(\xk, \dk\right)$ for each $k \in \naturals$.
Then \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_mf} is also satisfied.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

By \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f}, we can choose $\beta_1 \ge 1$ to be such that for all $k \in\naturals$:
\begin{align*}
\left\|\nabla^2 f\left(\xk\right) \right\| \le \beta_1 - 1.
\end{align*}
% \cref{model_improving_algorithm},
Because $Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised, we can use \cref{scale_the_radius} to bound $\left\|\hat M\left(\bar \Phi, Y\right)^{-1}\right\|$.    Thus, by \cref{3_16_replacement2},  we have
\begin{align*}
\left\|\nabla^2 f\left(\xk\right) - \nabla^2 m_f\left(\xk\right) \right\| \le \kappa_{h} \dk \le \kappa_{h} \Delta_{\text{max}}
\end{align*}
Defining $\beta_2 = \kappa_{h} \Delta_{\text{max}} + \beta_1 \ge 1$, we see that
\begin{align*}
\left\|\nabla^2 m_{f}\left(\xk\right)\right\| \le \left\|\nabla^2 m_{f}\left(\xk\right) - \nabla^2 f\left(\xk\right)  \right\| + \left\|\nabla^2 f\left(\xk\right) \right\|
\le \beta_2 - 1 .
\end{align*}
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{replacing_h3_again}
Suppose that Assumptions \ref{lipschitz_hessian} and \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f} hold.
Let the sequence of sample trust regions $\{ \sampletrk\}$ be suitable as defined in \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}.  Let $\mfk$ be the quadratic model functions constructed in \cref{model_construction_algorithm}.  Then \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_mf} is satisfied.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\sampletrk$ be defined by $\qk, \ck,\delta_k$ as in \cref{define_the_sample_region}.  Let $\ellipsek=\sampletrk$ and $\scaledellipsek$ be as defined in \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}.    By the definition of suitability, $\xk \in \scaledellipsek$, so by 
\cref{linear_accuracy_is_satisfied}, we have  
\[\|\nabla^2 \mfk(x) - \nabla^2 f(x)\| \le \kappa_{eh}'\delta_r \le \kappa_{eh} \Delta_k \le \kappa_{eh}\Delta_{\text{max}}.\]
By \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_f},  we have
%\begin{align*}
%\left\|\nabla^2 f\left(\xk\right) \right\| \le \beta_1 - 1.
%\end{align*}
%% \cref{model_improving_algorithm},
%Because $Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised, we can use \cref{scale_the_radius} to bound $\left\|\hat M\left(\bar \Phi, Y\right)^{-1}\right\|$.    Thus, by \cref{3_16_replacement2},  we have
%\begin{align*}
%\left\|\nabla^2 f\left(\xk\right) - \nabla^2 m_f\left(\xk\right) \right\| \le \kappa_{h} \dk \le \kappa_{h} \Delta_{\text{max}}
%\end{align*}
%Defining $\beta_2 = \kappa_{h} \Delta_{\text{max}} + \beta_1 \ge 1$, we see that
\begin{align*}
\left\|\nabla^2 m_{f}\left(\xk\right)\right\| \le \left\|\nabla^2 m_{f}\left(\xk\right) - \nabla^2 f\left(\xk\right)  \right\| + \left\|\nabla^2 f\left(\xk\right) \right\|
\le \kappa_{eh}\Delta_{\text{max}} + \beta .
\end{align*}
It follows that \cref{uniformly_bounded_hessians_of_mf} is satisfied for all $k$ with $\beta_2 = \beta+\kappa_{eh}\Delta_{\text{max}}$.
\end{proof}

% For any $x \in \feasible$, we have that the set of gradients of active constraints is linearly independent. That is, the vectors $\{\nabla c_i(x) |  \forall i \in \activei(x)\}$ is linearly independent.


%\subsection{Satisfying the accuracy assumption}
%\label{satisfying_accuracy}
%% To show that the accuracy condition \cref{accuracy} is satisfied, we need to impose some conditions on the ellipsoidal sample regions $\sampletrk$.
%% In particular, we require the ellipsoid to satisfy the following {\em suitability} condition:
%
%%After an ellipsoidal $\sampletrk$ is constructed,  sample points are then selected by applying  \cref{model_improving_algorithm} 
%%to a transformed problem in which the ellipsoid $\ellipsek$ is mapped onto a unit ball.
%%This process is summarized here.
%%
%%Given some symmetric matrix $\qk \succ 0$, we can give $\qk$ an eigen-decomposition $\qk = V D^2 V^T$,
%%where $V^TV = I$ and $D$ is a diagonal matrix with positive entries.
%%% In fact, because we require $\qk$ to be positive definite, the diagonal entries of $D$ are strictly positive.
%%For any
%%% $\delta = \max_{x\in \ellipsek}\left\|x-\ck\right\|$
%%$\delta > 0$ define $T:\Rn \times \Rn_+ \rightarrow \Rn$ by $T(x; \delta) = \frac{\delta}{\sdk} DL^T\left(x - \ck\right)$.
%%Note that $T$ is invertible and can map $\sampletrk$ onto the $\delta$-ball
%%$B_2(0;\delta) = \left\{u \in \Rn \; | \; \|u\| \le \delta\right\}$:
%%\begin{align*}
%%\delta^2 \ge \|T\left(x; \sqrt{2}\delta\right)\|^2 = \left\|\frac {\sqrt{2}\delta} {\sdk} DV^T(x - \ck)\right \|^2
%%= \frac {2\delta^2} {\sdk^2} \left(x - \ck\right)^TQ\left(x - \ck\right) \\
%%\Longleftrightarrow \left(x - \ck\right)^TQ\left(x - \ck\right) \le \frac 1 2 \sdk^2.
%%\end{align*}
%%Likewise, with $\scaledellipsek$ defined in \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}, we have that
%%$T\left(\scaledellipsek; \delta\right) = B_2(0; \delta)$.

%\begin{lemma}
%
%\label[lemma]{change_radius}
%% Suppose that \cref{bounded_hessians_assumption}, \cref{lipschitz_gradients_assumption}, and \cref{lipschitz_hessians_assumption} hold.
%
%Assume that a function $f$ is twice continuously differentiable in an open domain $\domain$ containing $B(y^{(0)}; \Delta)$ and $\nabla^2 f$
%is bounded by $\maxhessian$ and Lipschitz continuous in $\domain$ with constant $\liphess > 0$.
%
%% Let $f$ be a function with bounded, Lipschitz continuous hessian.
%
%% Assume that $f$ is twice continuously differentiable with bounded and Lipschitz continuous Hessian in $\domain$ with bound $M$ and Lipschitz constant $\liphess$.
%% Let $Y$ be a poised set of $p + 1$ points, and let $R = \max_{i}\|y^i - y^{(0)}\|$.
%% Let $m_f(x)$ denote the quadratic model of $f$ using \cref{reg}.
%
%Suppose further, that there exists a quadratic model $m_f$ and constants $\Lambda_1, \Lambda_2, \Lambda_3$ 
%such that for all $x \in B\left(y^{(0)}, \Delta\right)$,
%\begin{align*}
%\left|f(x) - m_f(x)\right| \le \Lambda_1 \\ % \Delta^3
%\left\|\gradf(x) - \nabla m_f(x)\right\| \le \Lambda_2 \\ % \Delta^2
%\left\|\nabla^2 f(x) - \nabla^2 m_f(x)\right\| \le \Lambda_3. % \Delta
%\end{align*}
%Then let $r > 1$ be arbitrary.
%There exist constants $\Lambda_1', \Lambda_2', \Lambda_3'$ such that for all $x \in B\left(y^{(0)}, r\Delta\right)$,
%\begin{align*}
%\left|f(x) - m_f(x)\right| \le \Lambda_1' r^2, \\ % \Delta^3
%\left\|\gradf(x) - \nabla m_f(x)\right\| \le \Lambda_2' r, \\ % \Delta^2
%\left\|\nabla^2 f(x) - \nabla^2 m_f(x)\right\| \le \Lambda_3' r .% \Delta
%\end{align*}
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{proof}
%
%Let $x \in B\left(y^{(0)}, r\Delta\right)$, and define
%\begin{align*}
%\Lambda_3' = \Lambda_3 + \liphess \Delta, \\
%\Lambda_2' = 2 \Delta M + \Lambda_2 +  \Delta \Lambda_3',\\
%\Lambda_1' = \Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2' \Delta.
%\end{align*}
%
%By assumption, $\left\|\nabla^2 f(x) - \nabla^2 f(y)\right\| \le \liphess\left\|x-y\right\| \forall x,y \in \domain$.
%Because of this, and because $m_f$ is a quadratic model, we have
%\begin{align*}
%\left\| \nabla^2 f\left(x\right) - \nabla^2 m_f\left(x\right)\right\|
%= \left\| \nabla^2 f\left(x\right) - \nabla^2 m_f\left(y^{(0)}\right)\right\| \\
%\le \left\| \nabla^2 f\left(x\right) - \nabla^2 f\left(y^{(0)}\right)\right\| + \left\| \nabla^2 f\left(y^{(0)}\right) - \nabla^2 m_f\left(y^{(0)}\right)\right\|
%\le \liphess \|x - y\| + \Lambda_3 \le  \Lambda_3' r .
%\end{align*}
%
%By the mean value theorem and by assumption $\left\|\nabla^2 f\right\| \le \maxhessian$, 
%there exist $\xi^{(1)} \in [y^{(0)}, x]$ and $\xi^{(2)} \in [y^{(0)}, x]$ with
%\begin{align*}
%\left\|\nabla f\left(x\right) - \nabla f\left(y^{(0)}\right) \right\|
%\le \left\|x - y^{(0)}\right\| \left\| \nabla^2 f\left(\xi^{(1)}\right) \right\|
%\le r \Delta \maxhessian, \\
%\left\|\nabla m_f\left(x\right) - \nabla m_f\left(y^{(0)}\right) \right\|
%\le \left\|x - y^{(0)}\right\| \left\| \nabla^2 m_f\left(\xi^{(2)}\right) \right\|
%\le r \Delta \left(\maxhessian + \Lambda_3'\right).
%\end{align*}
%Thus, 
%\begin{align*}
%\left\|\nabla f\left(x\right) - \nabla m_f\left(x\right)\right\| \le 
%\left\| \nabla f\left(x\right) - \nabla f\left(y^{(0)}\right) \right\| +
%\left\|\nabla f\left(y^{(0)}\right) - \nabla m_f\left(y^{(0)}\right)\right\| + \\ \left\|\nabla m_f\left(y^{(0)}\right) - \nabla m_f\left(x\right)\right\|
%\le r \Delta \maxhessian + \Lambda_2 + r \Delta \left(\maxhessian + \Lambda_3'\right) \\
%\le r \left(2 \Delta \maxhessian + \Lambda_2 +  \Delta \Lambda_3'\right)
%\le r \Lambda_2'.
%\end{align*}
%
%Finally, by the mean value theorem, there is a $\xi^{(3)} \in [y^{(0)}, x]$ with
%\begin{align*}
%\left|f(x) - m_f(x)\right|
%\le \left| f\left(y^{(0)}\right) - m_f\left(y^{(0)}\right) \right| + \left\| \nabla f\left(\xi^{(3)}\right) - \nabla m_f\left(\xi^{(3)}\right) \right\| \left\|x - y^{(0)}\right\| \\
%\le \Lambda_1 + \Lambda_2' \Delta r^2
%\le \Lambda_1' r^2.
%\end{align*}

%%%\end{align*}
%%% = \max_{x \in T^{-1}\left(B_2\left(0, \delta\right)\right)}\left\|x - \ck\right\|^2

%%Similarly, for the gradient we find:

%%& \le \sqrt{\condition(\qk)}\kappa_{eg} \delta_r^2 = \kappa_{eg}' \delta_r^2.
%%\end{align*}
%%Finally,  for the Hessian, we have
%%\begin{align*}
%%\| \nabla^2 m_f(x) - \nabla^2 f(x)\| & = \left\|\frac{\delta_r^2} {\sdk^2}DL^T\left(\nabla\hat m_f(u) - \nabla \hat f(u)\right)LD^T\right\| \\
%%& \le \frac{\delta_r^2} {\sdk^2} \|D\|^2\|\nabla \hat m_f(u) - \nabla \hat f(u)\| \\
%%& \le \condition(\qk)\kappa_{eh} \delta_r = \kappa_{eh}' \delta_r.
%%\end{align*}
%%
%%\end{proof}
%
%\cref{shifted_ellipsoid} shows that a uniform bound on the condition number of $\qk$ will produce accurate model functions.
%Indeed, recall from \cref{set_is_poised} that \cref{model_improving_algorithm} produces a $\Lambda$-poised sample set, for $B_2(0;\delta)$.
%Then \cref{scale_the_radius} and \cref{4_1_14} ensure $m_f$ will satisfy the provided error bounds over the ellipsoidal region as well.
%We can now satisfy the accuracy condition \cref{accuracy}.
%
%
%% It follows that  $m_f$ is $\kappa$ fully quadratic, with constants $\kappa_{ef}', \kappa_{eg}', \kappa_{eh}'$.  
%
%% Within our analaysis, we use this
%% \begin{align*}
%% \label{accuracy}
%% \end{align*}
%
%
%
%% \sbnote{Move the following to later}
%% For the purposes of a convergence proof, we need only satisfy the weaker accuracy condition \cref{accuracy}.
%% Notice that, in practice, the model functions do not need to be mapped to the $\delta$ ball, because $\Lambda$-poisedness is scale invariant \cite{introduction_book}.
%% The implications of this theorem are discussed further in the convergence discussion \cref{linear_convergence_discussion}.
%
%
%%Because the ellipsoid we construct must be feasible with respect to both the trust region and the constraints,
%%we simplify notation by creating a matrix $\lctra$ and vector $\lctrb$ from $\lca$ and $\lcb$ defined in \cref{eq:DFO-linear} as follows:
%%\begin{align}
%%\polyk = \{x \in \Rn | \; \lca x \le \lcb, \|x - \xk\|_{\infty} \le \dk \} \label{polyhedron_k} 
%%= \{x \in \Rn | \lctra x \le \lctrb, \|{\lctra}_i\| = 1 \}.
%%\end{align}
%%This is the normalized polyhedron formed by adding the trust region constraints for iteration $k$ to the problem constraints.
%%
%
%
%% The following is an immediate consequence of \cite[Lemma 3.8]{introduction_book}.
%% \begin{lemma}
%% \label{scale_the_set}
%% Let $\Delta, \Delta' > 0$.
%% If a set $\hat Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised over a ball $B(0; \Delta)$,
%% then the set $Y = \frac{\Delta'}{\Delta} \hat Y$ is $\Lambda$-poised over $B_2(0; \Delta')$.

%\begin{theorem}

%

%\left\|\nabla m_f\left(\xk\right) - \nabla f\left(\xk\right)\right\| \le \kappa_g \dk \quad \forall k \in \naturals.
%\end{align*}
%\end{theorem}
%
%\begin{proof}
%
%Fix an iterate $k$.
%The assumptions provide two ellipsoids:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\ellipsek = \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | \left(x - c^{(k)} \right)^T \qk \left(x - c^{(k)}\right) \le \frac 1 2 {\delta_k}^2 \right\}$ with $\ellipsek \subset \polyk$.
%\item $\scaledellipsek = \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | \left(x - c^{(k)}\right)^T \qk \left(x - c^{(k)}\right) \le {\delta_k}^2 \right\}$ with $\xk \in \scaledellipsek$.
%\end{itemize}
%As in \cref{shifted_ellipsoid}, we can give $Q^{(k)} = LD^2L^T$ its eigen-decomposition, 
%and for any $\delta > 0$ define the transformation $T(x; \delta) = \frac{\delta}{\sdk^2} D L^T\left(x - \ck\right)$.
%Notice that with $\delta = \delta_2 = \sqrt{2}$,
%the transformation $T\left(x; \delta_2\right)$ maps $\sampletrk = \ellipsek$ to the unit ball.
%After using \cref{model_improving_algorithm} to choose sample points, we know by \cref{set_is_poised}
%that there is a bound $\Lambda>0$ with $\left\| M\left(\bar \Phi, \hat Y\right)^{-1}\right\| \le \Lambda$ depending only on $p$ and $\ximin$.
%Next, we consider the shifted sample set $\bar Y = \sqrt{2}\frac{\delta_r}{\delta_2} \hat Y$, where $\delta_r = \max_{x \in \scaledellipsek}\|x - \ck\|$.
%Notice that the scaled matrix in $\cref{nce_scale}$ is $M\left(\bar\Phi, \hat Y\right) = \hat M\left(\bar \Phi, \bar Y\right)$, so we can use \cref{3_16_replacement2} to introduce constants $\kappa_f, \kappa_g, \kappa_h > 0$ such that
%\begin{align*}
%\left| \hat {f}\left(u\right) - \hat{m}_f\left(u\right) \right|\le \kappa_f\Lambda \delta_r^3, \\
%\left\|\nabla \hat {f}\left(u\right) - \nabla \hat{m}_f\left(u\right) \right\|\le \kappa_g\Lambda \delta_r^2, \\
%\left\|\nabla^2 \hat {f}\left(u\right) - \nabla^2 \hat{m}_f\left(u\right) \right\|\le \kappa_h\Lambda \delta_r.
%\end{align*}
%for all $u \in B_2\left(0, \delta_r\right)$.
%This means that the shifted functions
%$\hat {m}_f(u) = m_f(T^{-1}(u); \delta)$ and
%$\hat f (u) = f(T^{-1}(u; \delta))$
%as described in \cref{shifted_ellipsoid},
%satisfy \cref{shifted_ellipsoid_bounds}---\cref{shifted_ellipsoid_bounds3},
%and therefore \cref{transformed_error_bounds}---\cref{transformed_error_bounds3}.
%
%
%
%% and scaled sample set $\hat Y$ is lambda poised over $B_2(0; \delta_2)$.
%% that there exist constants $\kappa_f, \kappa_g, \kappa_h$ such that for all $u \in B(0, \delta_2)$:
%% \begin{align*}
%% \left\| \hat {f}\left(u\right) -  \hat{m}_f\left(u\right) \right\|\le \kappa_f \delta_2^3, \\

%% With , by \cref{scale_the_set},
%% we can scale these same points by $\frac{\delta_r}{\delta_2}$ to obtain a $\Lambda$ poised set over $B_2(0; \delta_r)$.
%% Thus, by \cref{quadratic_errors}, there exist constants $\kappa_f, \kappa_g, \kappa_h$ such that for all $u \in B_2(0; \delta_r)$:

%% \end{align*}
%% where $\kappa_{g}' = 16 \Lambda_2 L \sqrt{p+1}$.
%
%% After using  \cref{alphas_are_bounded} to construct an $\epsilon_{\alpha} > 0$ 
%Because $\condition \left(\qk\right)$ is bounded by some $\epsilon_{\alpha} > 0$ independently of $k$,
%and defining $\kappa'_{g} =  \kappa_g\sqrt{\epsilon_{\alpha}}\Lambda\dmax$, we see that
%we can use  \cref{shifted_ellipsoid} to conclude that for all $x_0 \in \scaledellipsek$:

%= \kappa'_g\dk.
%\end{align*}
%In particular, $\xk \in \scaledellipsek$.
%\end{proof}
%
%% Note that while applying \cref{quadratic_errors},
%% we assumed there is a point on the boundary of the sphere after running
%% \cref{model_improving_algorithm}.
%% In practice, this is not always ensured, but it is likely to be the case when a point of $Y$ is replaced.

We can now state our main convergence result:


\sbnote{Chapter 3 of the thesis never gave a "main convergence result" similar to Corollary IV.44 in the theis.   This was an oversight that we need to correct in the journal article.}
\begin{theorem}\label{main_result}
Suppose that Assumptions \cref{??}--\cref{??} are satisfied.   Blah blah blah. 
\end{theorem}

\section{Ellipsoidal Trust Region Approach}\label{sec:ellipsoidal}

The main idea of the ellipsoidal method is to define the sample trust region to be a feasible ellipsoid as in \cref{define_the_sample_region}:
\begin{align*}
\sampletrk = \ellipsek = \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | (x - \ck)^T \qk (x - \ck) \le \frac 1 2 \sdk^2 \right\}
\end{align*}
where $\qk$ is a positive definite matrix, $\ck$ is the center of the ellipsoid, and $\sdk$ is a constant determining the ellipsoid's radius.   
$\qk$ and $\ck$ are chosen so that the ellipsoid conforms roughly to the shape of the feasible region near the current iterate, 
while ensuring that it lies entirely within the intersection of the feasible region and the outer trust region.

% \cref{linear_convergence_discussion} analyzes the convergence of one version of the algorithm.


\subsection{A safe ellipsoid}

\subsubsection{Construction}
\label{the_safe_ellipsoid}

This section shows how to construct one possible ellipsoid that satisfies \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}.
We define the active constraints at a point $x \in \feasible$ by
\begin{align}
\activei(x) = \left\{i \in [m] | {\lca}_ix = {\lcb}_i \right\}. \label{define_activei}
\end{align}
Recall that $\lca$ and $\lcb$ are defined by \cref{eq:DFO-linear}.

For any iterate $k$, if there are no active constraints, $\activei\left(\xk\right) = \emptyset$, then we are free to choose
\begin{align}
\label{define_linear_trivial_ellipse}
\qk = I, \quad \ck = \xk, \quad \textrm{and} \quad \sdk = \min\left\{\dk, \min_{i \in [m]}{b_i - A_i x}\right\}.
\end{align}
We show within \cref{trivial_ellipsoid_exists} that this is a suitable ellipsoid.
Otherwise, we begin by constructing a direction $\uk$ that is maximally feasible with respect to the active constraints.
To make this precise, let $\mathcal S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, m\}$ be arbitrary.
We define the set of ``most'' feasible direction from $x$, and quantify how feasible they are with the definitions:
\begin{align}
\alphaone (\mathcal S) = \begin{cases}
\argmax_{\|u\| = 1} \min_{i \in \mathcal S} -u^T{\lca}_i & \text{if} \; \mathcal S \ne \emptyset \\
\emptyset & \text{if} \; \mathcal S = \emptyset
\end{cases} \label{define_alpha_one} \\
\alphatwo(\mathcal S) = \begin{cases}
\max_{\|u\| = 1} \min_{i \in \mathcal S} -u^T{\lca}_i & \text{if} \; \mathcal S \ne \emptyset \\
1 & \text{if} \; \mathcal S = \emptyset
\end{cases} \label{define_alpha_two} \\
\alphathree(x) = \alphatwo\left(\activei(x)\right). \label{define_alpha_three}
\end{align}
Here, $\alphaone$ is a set of directions that head away from each of the active constraints at a point.
For each iterate, this produces the quantities
\begin{align}
\alphak =  \alphathree\left(\xk\right) \label{define_alpha_k}, \\
\uk \in  \alphaone\left(\activei\left(\xk\right)\right). \label{define_u_k}
\end{align}
We then compute
\begin{align}
\alphakp=\left(1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\sqrt{1+\left(\alphak\right)^2}, \label{define_alphakp} \\
\deltaf = \frac 1 {\alphakp} \min\left\{\dk, \min_{i \in [m] \setminus \activei\left(\xk\right)} \left[{\lcb}_i - \left({\lca}_i\right)^T\xk\right]\right\}. \label{define_deltaf}
\end{align}
Notice that the minimization in the above expression computes the minimum distance to a non-active constraint.
It will be convenient to define the rotation matrix and affine mapping
\begin{align}
\rotk = 2\frac{(e_1 + \uk)(e_1 +\uk)^T}{(e_1 +\uk)^T(e_1 +\uk)} - \boldsymbol I, \label{define_r} \\
T_k(x) = \rotk\left(x - \xk\right). \label{define_affine_mapping}
\end{align}
Recall that $e_1 = (1, 0, \ldots, 0)^T$, and observe that $\rotk e_1 = \uk$, $\rotk \uk = e_1$, $\det(\rotk) = 1$, and 
$\rotk \rotk ^T = \rotk ^T\rotk = I$.

We can then define the ellipsoid as
\begin{align}
\label{define_linear_nontrival_ellipsoid}
\qk = \rotk^T \begin{pmatrix}
1 & \boldsymbol0^T \\
\boldsymbol 0 & \left({\alphak}\right)^{-2} \boldsymbol I \\
\end{pmatrix} \rotk,
\quad
\ck = \xk+\deltaf \uk,
\quad
\textrm{and}
\quad
\sdk=\deltaf
\end{align}
whenever $\activei\left(\xk\right) \ne \emptyset$.



% Now, fix some iterate $k$.
% If there are no active constraints, $\activei = \emptyset$, then we are free to choose
% \begin{align}
% \label{define_linear_trivial_ellipse}
% \qk = I, \quad \ck = \xk, \quad \textrm{and} \quad \sdk = \dk.
% \end{align}
% We show within \cref{trivial_ellipsoid_exists} that this is a suitable ellipsoid.

% Otherwise, we can use \cref{alphas_are_bounded} to satisify the conditions of \cref{nontrivial_ellipsoid_exists}.

\subsubsection{Suitability}

We show that this construction provides a suitable ellipsoid according to \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}.

% \begin{comment}
% Somehow it doesn't make sense to say that for an iterate, this construction satisfies a bound on the condition number.
% \end{comment}

\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{trivial_ellipsoid_exists}

Let $\activei$ be defined by \cref{define_activei}.

If $\activei\left(\xk\right) = \emptyset$ during iteration $k$, then \cref{define_linear_trivial_ellipse} defines a suitable ellipsoid for iteration $k$ according to \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}.
\end{lemma}
% $\epsilon > 0$, $c \in \Rn$  and a positive definite, symmetric matrix $Q$, 
\begin{proof}

If $\activei\left(\xk\right) = \emptyset$, then we are free to use \cref{define_linear_trivial_ellipse}.
This simplifies $\scaledellipsek$ to
\begin{align*}
\left(x - \ck\right)^2 \qk \left(x - \ck\right)^2 \le \sdk^2 \Longrightarrow \left\|x - \xk\right\|^2 \le \dk^2.
\end{align*}
Because $\ellipsek$ is then a sphere within the outer trust region with radius less than the distance to the nearest constraint, $\ellipsek \subseteq \polyk$.
Because the sphere $\scaledellipsek$ is centered at $\xk$, $\xk \in \scaledellipsek$.
Also, $\condition\left(\qk\right) = 1$.

% \color{red}
% \begin{align*}
% \min_{i \in [m] \setminus \activei\left(\xk\right)}{b_i - A_i x}
% \end{align*}
% \color{black}
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{alphas_are_positive}

Let $\alphathree$ be defined by \cref{define_alpha_three}.

Suppose that \cref{interior_point} holds.

Then, $1 \ge \alphathree(y) > 0$ for any $y \in \feasible$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Let $y \in \feasible$, and let $\activei(x)$ be defined by \cref{define_activei}.
If $\activei(y) = \emptyset$, then $\alphathree(y) = 1 > 0$.
Otherwise, let $i \in \activei(y)$, so that by \cref{eq:DFO-linear}, $c_i(y) (Ay - b)_i= 0$.
% We know that for each $i \in \activei(x_0)$ both $c_i(x_0) = 0$ and $c_i(\bar x) < 0$.
% subtract the equations: $G_i^T \bar x < g_i$ and $G_i^T  x_0 = g_i$ to find
We know that if $\bar x$ is defined as in \cref{interior_point}, then
\begin{align*}
c_i(\bar x) = c_i(y) + {\lca}_i(\bar x - y)
\Longrightarrow {\lca}_i(\bar x - y) \le c_i(\bar x) - c_i(y) = c_i(\bar x) < 0.
\end{align*}
Using \cref{polyhedron_k}, we can write this as
\begin{align*}
-{\lca}_i\frac {\bar x - y}{\|\bar x - y\|} > 0  \Longrightarrow \min_{i \in \activei(y)} -{\lca}_i\frac {\bar x - y}{\|\bar x - y\|} > 0.
\end{align*}
Using this along with the definitions of $\alphaone$, $\alphatwo$, and $\alphathree$ in \cref{define_alpha_one}, \cref{define_alpha_two}, and \cref{define_alpha_three}; we see
\begin{align*}
\alphathree(y) = \alphatwo\left(\activei(y)\right) = \max_{\|u\| = 1} \min_{i \in \activei(y)} -{\lca}_i^Tu
\ge \min_{i \in \activei(y)} - {\lca}_i^T\frac {\bar x - y}{\|\bar x - y\|} > 0.
\end{align*}

We know that $\alphathree(y) \le 1$ because it is the dot product of two vectors of length one:
if $\|u\| = 1$, then $\left|u^T {\lca}_i\right|^2 \le \|u\|\|{\lca}_i\| = 1$ by Cauchy–Schwartz.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{alphas_are_bounded}

Let ${\alphak}$ be defined by \cref{define_alpha_k}.

Suppose that \cref{interior_point} holds.

There exists an $\epsilon_{\alpha} > 0$ such that $\alphak \ge \epsilon_{\alpha} \; \forall \; k \in \naturals$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

Let $\activei$ be defined by \cref{define_activei}.
Because there are $m$ constraints, each $\activei(x)$ is one of the $2^m$ subsets of  $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, m\}$.
This means that $\alphaone$, $\alphatwo$, and $\alphak$ as defined by \cref{define_alpha_one}, \cref{define_alpha_two}, and \cref{define_alpha_k} can only take on at most $1 + 2^m$ values.
By \cref{alphas_are_positive}, we know that each of these values must be positive.
Thus, we are free to choose $\epsilon_{\alpha}$ to be the smallest of these values.
\end{proof}

% 
% \begin{align*}
% \|s\| \le \pi t \\
% u ^T(tu + s) \ge y \|tu + s\| \\
% t \ge y (t + \|s\|) \\
% \end{align*}

It will be useful to define some intermediate cones.
Namely, for any scalar $\pi$, direction $u$, and point $c$, we define the cone
\begin{align}
\mathcal C\left(\pi, u, c\right) = \left\{c + t u + s \in \Rn | \; s^Tu= 0, t \ge 0, \|s\| \le \pi t\right\}.
\end{align}
We can use this to define shifted and unshifted cones about the point $\xk$ along a direction $\uk$:
\begin{align}
\shiftedcone = \mathcal C\left(\alphak, e_1, 0\right), \label{defineshiftedcone} \\
\unshiftedcone = \mathcal C\left(\alphak, \uk, \xk\right). \label{defineunshiftedcone}
\end{align}

% \begin{boxedcomment}
% Illustrate the open rate...
% \end{boxedcomment}

Observe that, by construction, $\unshiftedcone$ is feasible with respect to the active constraints.
That is, $\lca_i x \le \lcb_i$ for all $x \in \unshiftedcone$ and $i \in \activei\left(\xk\right)$.
\cref{linear_cones_images} contains a depiction of these cones.

% \left\{x = (t, s)^T \in \Rn, t \in \mathbb R_{\ge 0}, s \in \mathbb R^{n-1} \bigg |\quad \|s\| \le {\alphak} t \right\} 

\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{unshiftedconeisfeasible}

Let $\unshiftedcone$ and $\polyk$ be defined by \cref{defineunshiftedcone} and \cref{polyhedron_k}.

The set $\unshiftedcone$ is feasible with respect to the active constraints of $\polyk$ at $\xk$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Note that the trust region boundary cannot be active at $\xk$ as $\dk > 0$.
Let $\activei$, $\alphak$, and $\uk$ be defined by \cref{define_activei}, \cref{define_alpha_k}, \cref{define_u_k} and
$\lca$ and $\lcb$ be defined by \cref{eq:DFO-linear}.
Let $y = \xk + t\uk + s \in \unshiftedcone$ and $i \in \activei\left(\xk\right)$ be arbitrary.
Then,
\begin{align*}
{\lca}_{i}^Ty - {\lcb}_{i} = {\lca}_{i}^T(t\uk + s) = {\lca}_{i}^Ts + t {\lca}_{i}^T\uk \le \|s\| - \alphak t \le 0.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

The following function is useful for showing results about our ellipsoids:
\begin{align}
f_{e}(\pi, \delta, r; x) = (x - \delta e_1)^T
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \boldsymbol0^T \\
\boldsymbol 0 & \pi^{-2} \boldsymbol I \\
\end{pmatrix}
(x - \delta e_1) - r. \label{define_ellipsoid_function}
\end{align}

\begin{lemma}

\label[lemma]{shifted_ellipsoid_in_cone}
Let $\shiftedcone, f_e, \alphak$ be defined as in \cref{defineshiftedcone}, \cref{define_ellipsoid_function}, \cref{define_alpha_k}.
Then, for all $\delta > 0$, the ellipsoid
\begin{align}
\left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | f_e\left(\alphak, \delta, \frac 1 2 \delta^2; x\right) \le 0 \right\} \subseteq \shiftedcone.
\end{align}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Suppose that $x \in \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg| f_e\left(\alphak, \delta, \frac 1 2 \delta^2; x\right) \le 0 \right\}$, 
and let $t = x^Te_1$, $s=x - t e_1$. 
Then
\begin{align*}
f_e(x) \le 0 &\Longrightarrow
(x - \delta e_1)^T\begin{pmatrix}
1 & \boldsymbol0^T \\
\boldsymbol 0 & \left(\alphak\right)^{-2} \boldsymbol I \\
\end{pmatrix}(x - \delta e_1) \le \frac 1 2 \delta^2  \\
&\Longrightarrow (t - \delta)^2 + \frac {1} {\left(\alphak\right)^2} \|s\|^2 \le \frac 1 2 \delta^2 \\
&\Longrightarrow \|s\|^2 \le \left(\alphak\right)^2 \left[\frac 1 2 \delta^2 - (t - \delta)^2\right] \\
&= \left(\alphak\right)^2 \left[t^2 - 2(t - \frac 1 2 \delta)^2 \right] \le \left(\alphak\right)^2t^2 \\
&\Longrightarrow \|s\| \le \alphak t.
\end{align*}
Thus, $x \in\shiftedcone$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{linear_mapping_works}

Let $\rotk$, $T_k$, $\unshiftedcone$, $\shiftedcone$ be defined as in
\cref{define_r}, \cref{define_affine_mapping}, \cref{defineunshiftedcone}, \cref{defineshiftedcone}.
Then $T_k(\unshiftedcone) = \shiftedcone$.
% and $T_k^{-1}(\shiftedcone) = \unshiftedcone$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Observe that $\rotk e_1 = \uk$, $\rotk \uk = e_1$, $\det(\rotk) = 1$, and 
$\rotk \rotk ^T = \rotk ^T\rotk = I$.

Suppose that $x \in \unshiftedcone$.
Then there exists $t \ge 0$ and $s \in \Rn$ such that $x = \xk + t \uk+ s$ where $s^T \uk = 0$ and $\|s\| \le {\alphak} t$.
Then $T_k(x) = t\rotk\uk + \rotk s = te_1 + \rotk s$.
Observe that $(Rs)_1 = (\rotk s)^Te_1 = s^T\rotk^T(\rotk \uk) = s^T \uk = 0$.
Hence,
$T_k(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
t \\
\sigma
\end{pmatrix}$ where $\sigma \in \mathbb R ^ {n-1}$ satisfies $\|\sigma\| = \|s\| \le \alphak t$.
Thus, $T_k(x) \in \shiftedcone$.
Conversely, if $\begin{pmatrix}
t \\
\sigma
\end{pmatrix} \in \shiftedcone$, then let
$s = \rotk^T\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
\sigma
\end{pmatrix}$
to see that
$x = T_k^{-1}\left(\begin{pmatrix}
t \\
\sigma
\end{pmatrix} \right)= \rotk^T\left(t e_1 + \begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
\sigma
\end{pmatrix}\right) = t \uk + s$, where
$\|s\| = \|\sigma\| \le \alphak t$.
Hence $T_k^{-1}\left(\begin{pmatrix}
t \\
\sigma
\end{pmatrix}\right) \in \unshiftedcone$.
\end{proof}

respectively.

For each iteration $k$, if $\activei\left(\xk\right) \ne \emptyset$, the ellipsoid
\begin{align}
\ellipsek = \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | f_e\left(\alphak, \deltaf, \frac 1 2 \deltaf^2; T_k(x)\right) \le 0\right\} \label{definefeasibleellipsoid}
\end{align}
satisfies $\ellipsek \subseteq \polyk$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}


% Let $L$ be the shortest distance from $\xk$ to any point on a non-active constraint.
% Define $\alphakp = \sqrt{\left(1 + \left(\alphak\right)^2 \right) \left(1 + \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}}\right)}$, and let $\deltaf = \frac 1 {\alpha'} L$.

\cref{define_alphakp}, \cref{define_r}, \cref{defineunshiftedcone}, and \cref{defineshiftedcone},

We see that if $x \in \ellipsek$,
then by \cref{shifted_ellipsoid_in_cone} we have that $T_k(x) = \begin{pmatrix}t\\ \sigma\end{pmatrix} \in \shiftedcone$ for some $\sigma \in \mathbb R^{n-1}$
with $\left\|\sigma\right\| \le \alphak$, and

\end{pmatrix}(x - \deltaf e_1) \le \frac 1 2 \deltaf^2 \\
\Longrightarrow (t - \deltaf)^2 \le (t - \deltaf)^2 + \frac {1} {\left(\alphak\right)^2} \|\sigma\|^2 \le \frac 1 2 \deltaf^2 \\
\Longrightarrow t \le \left(1 + \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}}\right) \deltaf
\end{align*}
so that 
\begin{align*}
\|x\|^2 = t^2 + \|\sigma\|^2 \le \left(1 + \left(\alphak\right)^2 \right) t^2 
\le \left(1 + \left(\alphak\right)^2 \right) \left(1 + \frac 1 {\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 \deltaf^2 
= \left(\alphakp\right)^2 \deltaf^2 \\
\Longrightarrow \|x\| \le \alphakp \deltaf \le \min_{i \in [m] \setminus \activei\left(\xk\right)} \left[{\lcb}_i - \left({\lca}_i\right)^T\xk\right].
\end{align*}
Thus, all points within $\ellipsek$ are closer than the nearest point of a non-active constraint.
Combine this with \cref{unshiftedconeisfeasible} to see that $\ellipsek \subseteq \polyk$.
\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{ellipsoid_includes_origin}

Let $\deltaf$, $\rotk$, $T_k$, $\unshiftedcone$, $\shiftedcone$, $\polyk$ be defined as in
\cref{define_deltaf}, \cref{define_r}, \cref{define_affine_mapping}, \cref{defineunshiftedcone}, \cref{defineshiftedcone}, \cref{polyhedron_k}.

For any iteration $k$,
the ellipsoid
\begin{align}
\scaledellipsek  = \left\{x \in \Rn | f_e\left({\alphak}, \sdk, \sdk^2; T_k(x)\right) \le 0\right\} \label{definescaledfeasibleellipsoid}
\end{align}
satisfies $\xk \in \scaledellipsek$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

We have that
\begin{align*}
f_e\left(\alphak, \deltaf, \deltaf^2; T_k\left(\xk\right) \right) =  
f_e\left({\alphak}, \deltaf, \deltaf^2; 0\right) = \\

\end{pmatrix}(0 - \deltaf e_1) = \deltaf^2 \le \deltaf^2.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}








% 
% 
% 
% 
% We will first define the ellipsoid and show some of its properties within the transformed space $C_2$ before mapping it to $C_1$.
% To this end, fix an arbitrary $\delta > 0$ and let 
% $f_{e}(x): \Rn \to \reals $ be defined by 
% \begin{align}
% f_{e}(x) = (x - \delta e_1)^T\begin{pmatrix}
% 1 & \boldsymbol0^T \\
% \boldsymbol 0 & \alpha^{-2} \boldsymbol I \\
% \end{pmatrix}(x - \delta e_1) - \frac 1 2 \delta^2
% \label{define_ellipsoid_function}
% \end{align} 
% and consider the ellipsoid $E_1 = \{x | f_{e}(x) \le 0\}$.
% We will show that $E_1 \subseteq C_2$.
% To this end, suppose $x = (t, s) \in E_1$.
% Firstly, note that
% \begin{align*}
% 2\big(t - \frac {\delta} 2\big)^2 \ge 0
% \Longrightarrow 2t\delta - \frac 1 2 \delta^2 \le 2t^2 
% \Longrightarrow \frac 1 2 \delta^2 - (t - \delta)^2 \le t^2. 
% \end{align*}
% \Longrightarrow \frac 1 2 \delta^2 -t^2  + 2t\delta - \delta^2 \le t^2 \\
% \Longrightarrow 0 \le t^2 - t\delta + \frac 1 4 \delta^2
%  \Longrightarrow 0 \le 2t^2 - 2t\delta + \frac 1 2 \delta^2\\

% We choose this mapping because if $x = x_0 + t u^{\star} + s \in C_1$,
% then $\|s\|\le \alpha t \Leftrightarrow \|Rs\| \le \alpha t$ and $0 = s^Tu^{\star} = s^T R^T R u^{\star} = (Rs)^T e_1$ imply that 
% $R(x - x_0 - \delta u^{\star}) = t Ru^{\star} + Rs = t e_1 + Rs \in C_2$.
% Thus, the affine mapping $T : \Rn \to \Rn$ defined by $T(x) = R(x - x_0 - \delta u^{\star})$ maps $C_1$ to $C_2$.
% Conversely, the same arguments show that $T^{-1}(x) = R^Tx + x_0 + \delta u^{\star}$ maps $C_2$ to $C_1$.

%  \in SO(n)
% u = [3957; 6294.9]
% u = u / norm(u)
% e = [1; 0.0]
% a = e + u
% r = 2 * a * a' / (a' * a) - eye(2)
% r * e
% r * u


% 
% Having proven that $E_1 \subseteq C_2$, it follows that $T^{-1}(E_1) \subseteq C_2$.
% However, $T^{-1}(E_1) = \{ x \in \Rn | (x - \delta u^{\star})^TQ(x-\delta u^{\star} \le \frac 1 2 \epsilon\}$ where

% 
% \begin{align*}
% E_2 = \bigg \{x \bigg | (x - x_0 - \delta u^{\star})^T\bigg(R^T\begin{pmatrix}
% 1 & \boldsymbol0^T \\
% \boldsymbol 0 & \alpha^{-2} \boldsymbol I \\
% \end{pmatrix}R\bigg)(x - x_0 - \delta u^{\star}) \le \frac 1 2 \delta^2 \bigg\}.
% \end{align*}
% We know that $x \in E_1 \Leftrightarrow T(x) = R(x - x_0 - \delta u^{\star}) \in E_2 \Longrightarrow T(x) \in C_2 \Longrightarrow x = T^{-1}\left(T(x)\right) \in C_1$.
% Thus, we know that the ellipsoid $E_2$ is contained within the active constraints, and can be scaled by $2$ to include $x_0$.

\begin{lemma}
\label[lemma]{nontrivial_ellipsoid_exists}

Let $\activei$ and ${\alphak}$ be defined by \cref{define_activei} and \cref{define_alpha_k}, respectively.

Suppose that \cref{interior_point} holds.

For some iteration $k$, if $\activei \ne \emptyset$, then the ellipsoid defined by \cref{define_linear_nontrival_ellipsoid}
is suitable according to \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}.

% For iteration $k$, if ${\alphak} > 0$, then there exists a suitable ellipsoid for iteration $k$ according to .
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Let 
$f_e$,
$T_k$,
$\rotk$, $\deltaf$, and $\scaledunshiftedellipsoid$
be defined as in
\cref{define_ellipsoid_function},
\cref{define_affine_mapping},
\cref{define_r},
\cref{definefeasibleellipsoid}, and
\cref{definescaledfeasibleellipsoid},
respectively. 
Observe that \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid} with \cref{define_linear_nontrival_ellipsoid} defines  $\ellipsek$ and $\scaledellipsek$ to be
\begin{align*}
\begin{array}{cccc}
\ellipsek &=& \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | f_e\left(\alphak, \sdk, \frac 1 2 \sdk^2; T_k(x)\right) \le 0\right\}, &\quad \textrm{and}  \\
\scaledellipsek &=& \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg | f_e\left({\alphak}, \sdk, \sdk^2; T_k(x)\right) \le 0\right\}.&
\end{array}
\end{align*}

By \cref{ellipsoid_fits}, we know that $\ellipsek \subseteq \polyk$.
By \cref{ellipsoid_includes_origin}, we know that $\xk \in \scaledellipsek$ .
By \cref{alphas_are_bounded}, there exists $\epsilon_{\alpha} > 0$, such that the condition number 
$\condition\left(\qk\right) = \frac{\max\{1, {\alphak}^{-2}\}}{\min\{1, {\alphak}^{-2}\}} = {\alphak}^{-2} > 0$.
This is because $\det\left(\rotk\right) = 1$ means the condition number of $\qk$ is not affected $\rotk$.
\end{proof}


% Let
% \begin{align*}
% \qk = \rotk^T\begin{pmatrix}

\subsection{Ellipsoid searches}

Within \cref{the_safe_ellipsoid}, we showed how to construct one possible ellipsoid that satisfies \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid}.
In practice, this ellipsoid could be less than desirable.
Within this section, we discuss the requirements of other variants of the \emph{ConstructTrustRegion} subroutine that we explored for practicality.
The key requirement is these ellipsoids must still satisfy \cref{define_suitable_ellipsoid} to share the same convergence results.

\subsubsection{Ensuring suitability}

To retain the convergence results, these algorithms maintain $\ellipsek \subseteq \polyk$,
$\xk \in \scaledellipsek $, and a bound on $\condition\left(\qk\right)$.

To ensure the condition number is bounded, the algorithm can compute the condition number of the safe ellipsoid, and only consider ellipsoids better conditioned.
Alternatively, it could introduce its own bound.
We found it simplest to parameterize ellipsoids by their Cholesky factorization $\qk = LL^T$.
Namely, we parameterized the search space in terms of a lower triangular matrix $L$, and required the diagonal entries to be positive.
To ensure a bounded condition number, we chose a $\epsilon_{\alpha} > 0$, and constrain  $\max_{i\in[n]} \le \epsilon_{\alpha} \min_{i \in [n]}$.
% Then requiring a 

One potential difficulty created by moving the ellipsoid center $\ck$ is that the current iterate $\xk$ may not lie within near the resulting ellipsoid.   
The pitfall is that the model function may lose accuracy near the current iterate.
Thus, we have implemented a few ways of ensuring the current iterate is within the search trust region.
This can be done by either of the following two options:
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding a constraint to the ellipsoid problem to include the original point.
\item Expanding the size of the ellipsoid.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Adding a constraint.}
In order to include the original point as a constraint, we add a constraint of the following form to the definition of the ellipsoid.
\begin{align*}
\frac 1 2 \left(\xk - \ck\right)^T\qk\left(\xk - \ck\right) \le \frac 1 2 \sdk^2.
\end{align*}
Constraints of this nature make finding the ellipsoid much more expensive:
the optimization problem we construct uses ${\qk}^{-1}$ as decision variables, so that constraints in terms of $\qk$ must model matrix inversion.

\paragraph*{Increasing the radius.}
An alternative is to scale $\qk$ by a constant.
We use a scaling factor $\sdk > 0$ defined by
\begin{align*}
\sdk = \max \left\{1, \sqrt{\left(\xk - \ck \right)^T \qk \left(\xk - \ck \right)} \right\}
\end{align*}
and let the ellipsoid be:
\begin{align*}
\ellipsek = \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg| \frac 1 2 \left(x - \ck\right)^T \qk \left(x - \ck\right) \le \frac 1 2 \sdk^2\right\}.
\end{align*}
However, this means that in general $\ellipsek \not \subset \feasible$.
so that the sample points must be contained to also lie within the feasible region: $\ellipsek \cap \feasiblek$.
For details on how to choose sample points with additional constraints, see \cref{model_improving_algorithm}.


%  \sbnote{This raises a number of questions.
%  First is whether the current iterate will be a sample point.
%  If it isn't, then the model function may disagree with the true function at the current iterate, 
%  so descent of the model function may not correspond to descent of the true function, even for very small steps.
%  Also, if the search region is chosen to be equal to the ellipsoidal region, then we may not be able to get descent at all.
%  At the end of the day,  we don't necessarily need the current iterate to be in the ellipsoid as long as
%  1) it is within the search trust region, and 2) the model function is sufficiently accurate over the search trust region.
%  Actually, we don't even need 2), do we?  We just need the accuracy condition to be satisfied at the current iterate, right?}


\subsubsection{Maximal volume ellipsoids}
\label{ellipse_optimization}

The error bounds given in \cref{shifted_ellipsoid} suggest that we can obtain more accurate model functions by 
minimizing the condition number of the matrix $\qk$.
However, we also desire a large ellipsoid so that our model will satisfy the error bounds over more of $\searchtrk$.
Thus, one choice for $\sampletrk$ is to choose the maximum volume ellipsoid that is both feasible and lies within the outer trust region.
We can accomplish this for various ellipsoid centers, by finding the maximal volume ellipsoid that is constrained to lie within the polytope
\begin{align*}
\polyk := \left\{x \in \Rn | \lca x\le \lcb,   \xki - \dk \le x_i \le \xki + \dk\right\}.
\end{align*}
% Note that we have replaced the usual trust region $B_2\left(\xk, \dk\right)$ with an $L_{\infty}$ ball, called the {\em outer trust region},
% defined in \cref{define_outer_trust_region}.

This is not the only reasonable approach: maximizing ensures a larger region for which the models will be accurate, 
but we are most interested in descent directions.
Namely, we may wish to use previously evaluated points to provide a hint of where the next ellipsoid should be.
Another consideration is where points have been evaluated: it may be more economical to choose a smaller ellipsoid that can reuse existing points.
However, in this section,  we consider the problem of choosing $\qk$ and $\sdk$ to maximize the volume of $\ellipsek \subseteq \polyk$ given a fixed center $\ck$.
Later, in \cref{center_searches}, we will explore strategies for moving the center of the ellipsoid to improve the performance of our trust region algorithm.

We adopt a method similar to that described in \cite{Khachiyan1993},
which presents an algorithm for finding the maximum volume ellipsoid inscribed in a given polytope.
% For the remainder of this section, we drop the superscript $(k)$ and write
% \begin{align*}
% P = \polyk =  \{ x \in \Rn\; | \;  Ax \le b \}.
% \end{align*}
% We wish to find the maximum-volume ellipsoid $E \subseteq P$ centered at a point $c \in P$.

% \bar{\lctrb}
Let $\bar g = \lctrb - \lctra \ck$ and $d = x - \ck$ so that the polytope becomes
\begin{align*}
\polyk = \left\{ \ck + d \in \Rn \; | \;  \lctra d \le \bar{g} \right\}.
\end{align*}
Using this transformation, the ellipsoid can then be centered at zero, and defined by a symmetric positive definite matrix $Q \succ 0$:
\begin{align*}
E = \left\{ d \in \Rn \; \bigg | \; \frac 1 2 d^T Q d \le 1 \right\}.
\end{align*}
Our goal is to determine the matrix $Q$ that maximizes the volume of $E$ such that $\mu + E \subset \mathcal{P}$.
This is accomplished by defining $\bar b = b - Ac$ and solving the following problem for $Q$ for a given center:
 \begin{align}
\begin{array}{cc}
 \sup_{Q \succeq 0} & \det(Q^{-1})  \\
 \textrm{s.t.} & A_i^T Q^{-1} A_i \le \frac 1 2 \bar{b_i}^2.
\end{array}
 \label{ellipse_1}
\end{align}


\begin{theorem} 

Let $\mathcal{P} = \{x \in \Rn | Ax \le b\}$, 
where $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, 
and $b \in \Rm$.  Let $c \in \intr{\mathcal{P}}$.

Suppose that some positive definite, symmetric matrix $Q$ solves \cref{ellipse_1}, where $\bar{b} = b - Ac$.
Then the ellipsoid $E = \{ x \in \reals^n | (x-c)^T Q(x-c) \le 1\}$ has the maximum volume over all ellipsoids centered at $c$ and contained in $\mathcal{P}$.
\end{theorem}


\pagebreak
\begin{proof}

Define the auxiliary function $f(d) = \frac 1 2 d^T Q d$ so that $E = \{ d \in \Rn\; | \; f(d) \le 1 \}$.
Because $Q$ is positive definite, $f$ has a unique minimum on each hyperplane $\left\{d \in \Rn | \; A_i d = b_i\right\}$.
Let this minimum be $d^{(i)} = \argmin_{A_id =\bar{b}_i} f(d)$ for $i\in[m]$.
By the first-order optimality conditions, there exists a $\lambda \in \Rm$ such that for each $i\in[m]$,
\begin{align*}
\nabla f(d^{(i)}) = Q d^{(i)} = \lambda_i A_i.
\end{align*}
Since $Q$ is invertible, we have $d^{(i)} = \lambda_i Q^{-1}A_i$. 
We also know that $A_i^T d^{(i)} = \bar{b_i}$, so 
\begin{align*}
A_i^T \lambda_i Q^{-1}A_i = \bar{b_i} \Longrightarrow
\lambda_i = \frac {\bar{b_i}}{A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i},
\end{align*}
so that
\begin{align*}
d^{(i)} = \lambda_i Q^{-1}A_i = \frac {\bar{b_i}}{A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i}  Q^{-1}A_i \quad \forall 1\le i\le m.
\end{align*}
Because $E \subset \mathcal{P}$, we also know that $f(d^{(i)}) \ge 1$ for each $i$. Thus,
\begin{align*}
\frac 1 2 (d^{(i)})^{T} Q d^{(i)} \ge 1 \\
\Longrightarrow & \frac 1 2 \bigg(\frac {\bar{b}_i}{A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i}  Q^{-1}A_i\bigg)^{T} Q \frac {\bar{b}_i}{A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i}  Q^{-1}A_i \ge 1 \\
\Longrightarrow & \frac 1 2 \frac {1}{A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i}  \bar{b_i} A_i^T Q^{-1} Q \frac {\bar{b_i}}{A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i}  Q^{-1}A_i \ge 1 \\
\Longrightarrow & \frac 1 2 \frac {1}{A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i}  \frac {\bar{b_i}^2}{A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i}  A_i^T Q^{-1}A_i \ge 1 \\
\Longrightarrow & \frac 1 2  \frac {\bar{b_i}^2}{A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i} \ge 1 \\
\Longrightarrow & \frac 1 2 \bar{b_i}^2\ge A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i \\
\Longrightarrow & A_i^T  Q^{-1}A_i \le \frac 1 2 \bar{b_i}^2.
\end{align*}

Because the volume of the ellipsoid is proportional to the determinant of $Q^{-1}$, the maximal ellipsoid is defined by \cref{ellipse_1}.
\end{proof}


Notice that the constraints for \cref{ellipse_1} can be simplified for the outer trust region's constraints.
These take the form:
\begin{align*}
e_i^T\left(\frac{\qk}{\frac 1 2 \sdk^2}\right)^{-1} e_i \le \left[e_i^T\left(\xk - \ck\right) \pm \dk \right]^2 \quad \forall i \in [n]
\end{align*}
or
\begin{align}
\label{ellipsoids_trust_region_constraints}
\left(\frac{\qk}{\frac 1 2 \sdk^2}\right)_{i,i}^{-1} \le \left[\xki - \ck_i \pm \dk \right]^2 \quad \forall i \in [n].
\end{align}



\section{Results}

\subsection{Algorithm variants}

Here, we present numerical results for our implementations of \cref{linearly_constrained_dfo_simple}.
We begin by describing the different ways we implemented \emph{ConstructTrustRegion}.

\subsubsection{Circular trust region}

The simplest approach to maintaining a feasible trust region is to set the inner trust region radius sufficiently small.
Within the \emph{ConstructTrustRegion} subroutine, this method sets the trust region radius to the distance to the closest constraint:
$\outertrk = B_2\left(\xk, \min\left\{\dk, \min_{i}\frac{\left|A_i\xk - b_i\right|}{\left\|A_i\right\|} \right\}\right)$.
In practice, this does not work well as the radius can become too small to allow adequate progress.

Two general strategies were considered for addressing this issue as illustrated in \cref{options_basis}.
One option is to shift the center of the inner trust region as long as it remains within the outer trust region.
The second option is to elongate the trust region along the nearest constraint as discussed in the next section.
Of course, both of these can be done at the same time.


\begin{figure}[ht]

    \includegraphics[width=200px]{images/small_circle.png}

    	The star is the current iterate, the outer trust region is in green, and the inner trust region is in blue.
    }
    \label{options_basis}
\end{figure}


In order to address this issue, we considered using ellipsoidal trust regions.
Whereas the circle does not allow improvement when the current iterate lies along a constraint, an ellipsoid elongates along this constraint.
In figure \cref{ellipse_adv}, we have this type of iterate, but by using an ellipsoid we are still able to search towards the vertex of the feasible region.

    \caption[An ellipsoidal trust region allows for more progress than a circular trust region.] {

    }
    \label{ellipse_adv}
\end{figure}

More specifically, at iteration $k$, we choose a scaling factor $\sdk$ and solve for an ellipsoid center $\ck \in \Rn$ and positive definite matrix $\qk$ to define an ellipsoid
\begin{align*}
\ellipsek = \left\{x \in \Rn \bigg| \; \frac 1 2 \left(x - \ck\right)^T\qk\left(x - \ck\right) \le \frac 1 2 \sdk^2 \right\}.
\end{align*}
The simplest approach is to simply let the center of the ellipsoid be the current iterate: $\ck = \xk$.





% \item How do we choose $\ellipsek$ to make the  ellipsoid as large as possible while ensuring that $ \ellipsek \subset \outertrk \cap \feasible $?




% ====================
% \sbnote{Move the following to somewhere else.}
% The advantage of the ellipsoidal trust region approach \cref{bluepill} is that we can reuse classical methods for ensuring good geometry.
% We can construct $\sampletrk$ to be ellipsoidal and use efficient algorithms within \cite{introduction_book} to satisfy \cref{accuracy}.
% However, we must be careful while choosing $ \searchtrk$ to allow sufficient reduction when we solve the trust region subproblem using the inner trust region.
% The search trust region is used while selecting the next iterate:
% \begin{align*}
% \sk = \argmin_{s \in \searchtrk} \mfk(\xk + s).
% \end{align*}
% =====================






\subsubsection{Choosing the ellipsoid center}
\label{center_searches}

The most obvious choice for the center of the ellipsoid is to choose $\ck = \xk$ (i.e., the current iterate).  
However, if $\xk$ is too close to a boundary of the feasible region, this can result in a badly shaped or very small ellipsoid.
We, therefore, explore strategies where the \emph{ConstructTrustRegion} subroutine moves the center of the ellipsoid away from the boundary. 
This is depicted in \cref{ellipse_adv}.


% We let the volume of the ellipsoid $E$ at center $c$ be given by $V(c) = \det(Q^{-1}) $.

\paragraph{Outer trust region search.}

One approach is to search all possible centers within $\feasible \cap \outertrk $.  
% That is, we solve:  \sbnote{Why do you use $\sdk$ in the following?}
% \begin{align*}
% \ck = \sup_{c \in \feasible \cap \outertrk} V(c)
% \end{align*}
% where $V(c)$ is the volume of the ellipsoid defined in \cref{ellipse_1}.

This has the advantage that it allows for the largest volume.
However, one problem with this search is that it can force the trust region away from the descent direction.
Notice that in \cref{ellipse_runs_away}, although the ellipsoid found has larger volume than before being shifted, 
this ellipsoid contains points farther from the corner that happens to contain the trust region's minimizer.
Within the numerical results, these algorithms are described as ``ellipse everywhere''.

The following section addresses this problem by proposing a path search method for choosing the ellipsoid center.

\paragraph{Path searches.}

% \sbnote{This discussion is quite vague, and in my opinion, off target.  
% You don't necessarily want to be moving toward a vertex.   
% You just don't want your ellipsoid to move in the opposite direction as  the descent direction.}

% Although $\mfk$'s minimizer over $\outertrk$  can appear anywhere, there are some reasons for expecting it to be at a ``vertex."
% If it lies in the interior, there is little need for using constrained approaches once near the solution.
% 
% 
% %The ellipsoid with maximum volume, however, tends to lead $ \sampletrk $ away from vertices.
% One way of trying to ensure a feasible direction towards a vertex, while still allowing a larger volume ellipsoid, 
% is by limiting the search for the new center to lie on a piecewise linear path starting at the current iterate $\xk$.

Rather than searching over all possible centers, it may be more efficient to only move away from the boundary.
This can be done using one-dimensional search along an appropriate direction.
For example, our first attempt was to simply search a line directed orthogonally away from the closest constraint.
This has obvious problems as shown in \cref{first_line_search}: we should avoid letting the new center get closer to another constraint.    

% \sbnote{This could be clearer.
% A key point is that with this method, you can determine the ellipsoid center simply by moving along this line until you are equidistant from the 2 closest constraints.
% Thus,  there is little gain if the current iterate is close to two or more constraints.}

To fix this, we search along a piecewise linear path leading away from the closest constraints.   
The algorithm works by choosing a set of breakpoints $s_0, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{n_{\text{points}}}$
that are each equidistant to a subset of the constraint's faces.
Intuitively, the search moves away from the nearest constraint until it reaches a point equidistant to the second nearest constraint, and so on.
The center search then considers points along the line segments between these points.
% Namely, it starts at the current iterate and travels along a ray away from all the closest constraints until it reaches a point equidistant to yet another constraint.

More precisely, the first point is chosen to be the current iterate: $s_0 = \xk$.
The algorithm then repeats the following process for $i$ from $0$ to $n_{\text{points}}-1$.
First, compute the set of nearest constraints, where the distance from the current point $s_i$ to each constraint $A_j$ for $j \in [m]$: 
is given by $d_j = b - A_j x$.
Recall that the rows of $A$ are normalized: $\left\|A_j\right\| = 1 \quad \forall j \in [m]$.
While finding the next point $s_{i+1}$, let  $E$ be the indices of $A$ whose constraints are equidistant and nearest to $s_i$:
$\{j \in [m] | d_j = \min_{l \in [m]} d_l\}$.
Let the remaining indices be $R = [m] \setminus E$.
The algorithm chooses a search direction $p = {A_E}^Tr$ as a linear combination of the normal vectors of the nearest constraints.
%When the constraint violation of $s_i$ is non-zero, this search ray can be found by finding the point that doubles the current slack ${A_E}s_i-{b_E}$.
%This is given by $r{A_E}^T$ where $r$ solves the linear system ${A_E}(s_i + r{A_E}^T) - b_E = 2 ({A_E}n_i - b_E)$.
%If the current violation is zero, then the right hand side can be set to a vector of all ones to ensure that all slacks violations are the same: $A_E(s_i + r{A_E}^T) - b_E = 1$.
This search ray $r$ can be found by computing a point $s_i$ whose distance to each equidistant constraint is twice its current value:
\begin{align*}
b_E - A_E(s_i + {A_E}^Tr) = 2 \left[b_E - A_Es_i\right] \Longrightarrow r = \left[A_E{A_E}^T\right]^{-1}\left(b_E + A_E s_i\right).
\end{align*}
% $A_E(s_i + r{A_E}^T) - b_E = 1$.
We can travel along this ray until we reach a point that is the same distance to a remaining constraint.
By travelling a distance $t$, we see that the $j$-th constraint becomes active when
$A_j (s_i + t p) = b_j \Longrightarrow t = \frac{b_j - A_j s_i}{A_jp}$
so that we can travel by 
$t = \min_{j \in R} \left\{\frac{b_j - A_j s_i}{A_jp}  \right\}. $
We set $s_{i+1} = s_{i} + t p$.
This process is described in \cref{segment_construction}.
Of course, $n_{\text{points}}$ must be less than or equal to $n + 1$ in order for this to be defined.

% \begin{comment}
% Also, the algorithm must stop early if $A_E$ contains $n$ parallel normal vectors: 
% as there will no longer be a direction that leads away from all constraints.

Once each end point $s_i$ is computed, the algorithm searches along each line segment $[s_{i-1}, s_i]$ for $i \in [n_{\text{points}}]$.
This means that we can define a class of searches that each limit the number of line segments to search $n_{\text{points}}$.
Within the results, these algorithms are described as ``ellipse segment $n_{\text{points}}$''.

\subsection{Buffered segments}

Even with these modifications, the iterates may approach the boundary of the feasible region.
Another way of dealing with this is to shift the constraints closer to the current iterate.
Namely, we introduce a parameter $\upsilon$ to determine how far to scale the constraints.
Then, within the trust region subproblem, we add constraints of $Ax \le b\upsilon + (1-\upsilon) A \xk $.
This produces the buffered segment searches within the results.

\paragraph*{Circumscribed ellipse.}

We also implemented a variant of the algorithm in which the sample region is a smallest volume ellipsoid to contain the feasible region.
Notice the ellipsoid necessarily includes points that are outside the current trust region and may include infeasible points.
Thus, both the trust region and linear constraints have to be added to the optimization problem defining the replacement point while computing the Lagrange polynomials.
For more details about this modified model improvement algorithm, see \cref{sec:polyhedral}.

\subsection{Sample problem}

The first test was on a problem with simple constraints and a pathological objective.
We let $f(x) = \epsilon x + (1-\epsilon)(y - \alpha x \sin(\gamma x))^2$ for a fixed constant $\epsilon$, and set the constraints to be
$x_2 \le ax_1$, $x_2 \ge -ax_1$ for a fixed constant $a$.
We summarize the number of function evaluations and iterations taken within \cref{linear_pathological_results}.

In general, we notice the linear models use fewer evaluations than quadratic models.
We see that the method with the fewest iterations and function evaluations is the linear polyhedral shape.
This is likely because the polyhedral shape is allowed to search the entire outer trust region.
This also explains why the circumscribed ellipse and maximum volume simplex also perform well.
%We also notices that with a simple heuristic we were able to improve the ellipse slightly from 170 to 157.
Also, the scaled ellipsoid performs comparably to the unscaled version.

\subsection{Hock-Schittkowksi test problems}


We tested these algorithms on several problems from the Hock-Schittkowski problem set \cite{Schittkowski1981MoreTE} and \cite{Hock1980}.
We selected the problems that have linear constraints: 21, 24, 25, 35, 36, 44, 45, 76, 224, 231, 232, 250, 251.
We summarize the results within \cref{linear_schittowski_results}.

% 37 was left out because it proved to be difficult.

\paragraph*{Performance profile.}
\label{performance_profile}
In order to better evaluate the algorithms on the problems across in this test set, we use a performance profile developed in \cite{More:2009:BDO:1654367.1654371}.
Given a set of Solvers $\mathcal S$ that solved a set of problems $\mathcal P$ with the number of evaluations of solver $s$ on problem $p$ being $N(s, p)$, the performance ratio is defined to be $r(s, p) = \frac{N(s, p)}{\min_{s \in \mathcal S} N(s, p)}$.
If the algorithm does not complete, then the number of evaluations is set to $\infty$.
The performance profile of a solver $s$ and parameter $\alpha \in [0, \infty)$ is then the number of problems for which the performance ratio is less than or equal to $\alpha$: 

\begin{align}
\rho(s, \alpha) = \frac 1 {\left\|\mathcal P \right\|} \left\|p \in \mathcal P | r(s, p) \le \alpha\right\|.
\end{align}

The $y$ axis of a performance plot is the performance profile, and the $x$ axis is the parameter $\alpha$.
Note that algorithms with high performance profiles for small values of $\alpha$ solved a large number of problems the most with the fewest evaluations, while algorithms that eventually reach high performance profiles with larger values of $\alpha$ solve a large set of problems.
The performance profile for the Hock-Schittkowski problem set is given in figure \cref{performance_profile_image}.

\end{figure}



The line segment search with 5 segments does not solve many problems, this is because several of the problems have dimension less than $5$, so that it was not even run on these.
Notice that the polyhedral search does very well.
We conjecture that this may not hold with modeled, nonlinear constraints.

% \section{Figure out where goes}
% 
% From here on, we will assume that the iterates $\xk$ are chosen according to \cref{linearly_constrained_dfo}.
% This implies that each of the sample points used to construct $\mfk$ are output of \cref{model_improving_algorithm}.
% 
% Because \cref{lipschitz_gradient} and \cref{lipschitz_hessian} are satisfied, $f$ also satisfies \cref{introduction_3_1} and hence the assumptions for \cref{quadratic_errors}.
% Notice that because $\kappa_f$, $\kappa_g$, $\kappa_h$ only depend on $p$, $L_h$, and $\Lambda$, these values do not depend on the iteration $k$:
% using the same tolerance $\xi_{\text{min}}$ within \cref{model_improving_algorithm} implies a bound on $\Lambda$.
% , and therefore $\mfk$ satisfies the requirements for \cref{quadratic_errors}.
